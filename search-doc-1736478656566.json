If existing components or patterns will not work to address needed designs, teams can suggest new components or patterns by going through the process outlined below. All new components or patterns should go through this process. We recommend starting this process before sharing new designs widely with stakeholders. This process works best if started before development begins, during the design phase. When considering if a component or pattern should be added to the design system there are a few criteria that define a “good” candidate: The component or pattern is already being used on more than one screen, or the designer can give examples of multiple places the component could be used.The component or pattern is different in more than one major way than existing components in the design system, if the component is only different in color or format, for instance, then it would be better as a variant of the existing component. Note that variants of existing components should also go through this experimental process.Our existing components and patterns will not solve the user problems sufficiently.Native components and patterns will not solve the user problems sufficiently.

Note: alpha builds should never be used in production. There are a couple additional methods to manually check if a component works inside an app environment, but neither works as well as the preferred method and may not behave the same as a published package (e.g. changes may work using these methods that would not work in a published NPM package): Alternate Method 1 The first option is to manually install the local component into the app you're testing in by running: yarn add file:../../va-mobile-library/packages/components (assumes va-mobile-app and va-mobile-library are siblings, if they are not, change the path). This method points directly to the component file you're testing. The downside here is that your watch command may not work, so you'll need to rebuild the app to see changes (or update the watch configuration). Alternate Method 2 The second is to use local dependency linking through yarn commands. This creates a symlink to the local component from the app. There are some Metro config changes that need to happen for this to work and support is a little iffy at the moment, but it's certainly an option, although not highly recommended at this point. With all methods above, you can validate things have installed correctly looking up the @department-of-veterans-affairs/mobile-component-library folder within your package folder (e.g. node_modules) and validating the correct package version is present. You can then run all app-level tests on it (manual app use, unit, compiling, e2e). The level of testing needed will be defined by the size of the update that is being made.

If you are contributing many tokens or need to adjust build processes, you should get set up locally. See the directions in the components package documentation for doing so with minor modifications to that process of changing directory to the tokens package (va-mobile-library/packages/tokens) instead of components and not having the final running steps as the tokens:build command is essentially running the tokens as it generates the output folders based on the build/config setup and tokens in the src/ folder.

Guidance in this section to be retired at version 1.0.0 Despite technically being in production, the design system is still in early, rapidly iterative phases. With only the VA Health &amp; Benefits app leveraging and close team contact, through at least Q1 2024 we plan to use a pre-launch versioning (major version 0) as follows: Version 0.1.0 will be a level set of the package highlighting it's in a workable state with baseline functionality that has been proven consumable by an outside project For components: Segmented Control ready to useFor tokens: Baseline set of color tokens availableFor other packages: When the package has a core piece of functionality and is stably leveraged by an outside project Any/all breaking changes will be minor version increments with tickets created for the VA Flagship Mobile Team providing specific guidance of necessary adjustmentsAside from breaking changes, semver is updated according to long term guidance below This policy will allow flexibility around anticipated growing pains that may entail more frequent breaking changes than more mature design systems. Once initial adoption challenges have been addressed and the packages have reached a degree of maturity in terms of content, version 1.0.0 will be published and follow the guidelines established below. The guidance around versioning for the VA Mobile Libraries shall be as follows: Major Breaking changes, large or small, that may require app-level changes to upgrade; examples: Non-backwards compatible update to an existing component property; e.g. renaming or restructuring how data is passedRemoval of deprecated token(s)/component(s)/etc. Underlying dependency update introducing incompatibility; e.g. new version of react-native that breaks compatibility to app-level versionIn exceptional cases, may be incremented for a very significant package enhancement or totality of modest ones that comprise a bonafide &quot;release&quot; even without breaking changes Minor Substantive functionality enhancements that are fully backward compatible, examples: New token(s)/component(s)/etc.Enhancing a component with a new variant Patch Minor functionality enhancements that are fully backward compatible, examples: Adding a new property of minor impactUpdating an existing component property with new values that have a minor impactFixing internal bugs Beta External team testing build denoted by a -beta.# appended to the semverShould not be used in production outside exceptional circumstances Alpha Internal design system team testing build denoted by a -alpha.# appended to the semverShould not be used in production The Figma Design Library will also follow this versioning guidance except only reflecting major/minor levels.

Such notifications may be errors, warnings, and general updates.In-application system status. An exception to the above is providing information to the user, unprompted, about a problem with a particular application. These system status messages typically use an error or warning variation and do not require user action.Access messages when a user tries to access an item that is not available to them. Access messages typically warn the user that something they tried to access is not working correctly or is temporarily unavailable. These often use the error or warning variations.Mobile app only: System maintenance. On the website, most system messages related to maintenance are handled by the Banner - Maintenance component.

An alert may be a validation message that informs a user they just took an action that needs to be corrected or a confirmation that a task was completed successfully.User feedback.

These messages use success and error variations.Immediate feedback to the user. When your application is using Javascript to provide an immediate response to the user without a full page/screen load. For example, this may include alerts that appear with inline form validation. Engagement messages that nudge the user to enter or update data. Engagement messages typically use the informational variation and ask the user to take an action.Mobile app only: Unprompted and in-page alerts.

When the user takes an action in which the system needs to clarify their intent, use an action sheet (for both iOS and Android) to offer the user a choice in how to proceed.Alert/dialogue. When the user chooses to do something that has serious consequences, use a native modal alert (for iOS) or dialogue (for Android) to present the user with critical information related to that action.Snackbar. If a user action triggers an API call that is successful or results in an error, consider using a Snackbar in addition to or instead of an Alert. The snackbar may allow users to take an action on the feedback such as trying again or undoing the action. On the mobile app, do not use the Alert component for: Sub-alerts on the page. On the website, when your page has more than 1 alert and you are using the Standard and Slim alerts to create a hierarchy of alerts. It is also appropriate to convey multiple statuses using a combination of headers, text, and the Slim alert variation. An example of a sub-alert is the Autosave alert. On the mobile app, do not use sub-alerts. On the website and mobile app, do not use the Alert component for: Long forms. On long forms, always include in-line validation in addition to any error messages that appear at the top of the form.Destructive actions. If an action will result in destroying a user’s work (for example, deleting an application) use a more intrusive pattern, such as a confirmation modal dialogue on the website or a native alert on the mobile app, to allow the user to confirm that this action is what they want.Clarifying background information. Use the Additional info component when clarifying outcomes for an input or a form question as well as providing background information.

"},{"title":"Types​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Design tokens","url":"/va-mobile-app/design/Foundation/Design tokens/#types","content":"There are three types of design tokens in the VA Design System: 1. Primitive​ Primitives mainly come from the USWDS. They are the building blocks that we use. The VA Design System does not use nor add any colors, fonts, nor spacing units that are not defined in the U.S. Design System. The mobile app library shares primitive tokens with VADS. For example, vads-color-base is a primitive token that references the USWDS token for #1B1B1B.  2. Semantic​ Semantic tokens communicate how a primitive is used. These tokens capture a semantic meaning that should relay the context in which that token should be used. In the mobile app library, semantic tokens reference primitive tokens and are sometimes shared with VADS. Since the mobile app library needs to account for theming, we currently maintain our own semantic tokens for light and dark mode. For example, vads-color-fg-default-on-light and vads-color-fg-default-on-dark are the default colors used for foreground elements such as text and icons. They reference VADS’ primitive tokens – vads-color-base and vads-color-base-lightest.  3. Component​ Component tokens are scoped to a specific component and represent decisions specific to that component. In the mobile app library, component tokens reference primitive or semantic tokens and are sometimes shared with VADS. Since the mobile app library needs to account for theming, we currently maintain our own component tokens for light and dark mode. For example, vads-segmented-control-color-fg-default-on-light and vads-segmented-control-color-fg-default-on-dark reference the default colors used for foreground elements such as text and icons.

Preferably, choose generic icons that could be reused in various applications. If VADS and USWDS do not contain a suitable icon, you may search Material Icons or browse the official Material Design Icons Figma plugin by Google. Note that we typically use the &quot;filled&quot; icon style.Also, note that all Material Design Icons are 24dp x 24dp and have 2dp of padding surrounding the live area.

"},{"title":"Inclusive meeting best practices​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Team norms","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/About our team/team-norms#inclusive-meeting-best-practices","content":"Try to share the meeting agenda and materials ahead of time. This allows folks to come to the meeting prepared with questions, review them async if that is more comfortable, or follow along if they can’t attend a meeting. Also it’s helpful to add timecodes when creating meeting invites.Turn on live captioning for every call. Live captioning services are a critical way for some individuals to understand and participate in meetings.Connect your speech and visuals. Try to connect the subject of your talk to the presentation or on-screen visuals. This helps folk understand who might not be able to see on-screen. If folks are using captions remember that during screen share it means they might immediately see or be reading the captions in real-time.Be mindful of the clock. If you are leading a meeting try to time box agenda items so that everyone gets what they need and expect out of the meeting. If you are participating in a meeting try to keep discussion focused to the agenda so the team can try to work through all the items.Use the raise hand feature in meetings. It helps give everyone a chance to take a turn, and helps facilitators moderate discussions. This also will help people using accessibility tools who may otherwise miss verbal or visual cues. Stay on mute until it is your turn to talk. Interruption and interjections can make live captioning difficult. For people using live captioning (or transcription) services, even innocuous interjections, affirmations, and “hmms” can make it difficult to follow the transcript.Unless called on directly, take turns making space to let other folks speak or answer a question. Helps everyone get a chance to speak in meetings and get experience presenting ideas.Cameras encouraged but optional. Zoom fatigue, anxiety, ADHD, chaotic children or pets, and other life things can make turning your camera on a negative experience. In large group meetings try to turn your camera on during the first 2-3 minutes to say hello. Or try turning it on for small group meetings and/or one-on-ones. It’s nice to see folks' faces, but we’ll leave the choice to be on camera up to you.Consider which chat method would work best for your meeting. For some folks, especially those who might be using assistive technology, discussions in the meeting chat software can be distracting or confusing to follow. Also the discussion often will be lost once the meeting ends which means folks not in attendance could miss out. One option is to capture those comments and conversations in Slack or in an asynchronous document used for the meeting. Other caption specific pro-tips we’ve learned​ Turn on captions for yourself and follow them to make sure what you are saying is translating correctly. For example, some names don’t translate well so you may need to also say folk’s title (e.g. “Let’s check with the product manager on that feature”). Captioning software can struggle if folks talk too fast. It will attempt to autocorrect words as it goes, but keep in mind that you might have to talk a bit slower so it can translate correctly. Captions can be a second or more behind so folks may need time to catch up.Google Meet: You don’t need to do anything to enable captions on Google Meet.Zoom: If you are hosting Zoom meetings here is info on how to enable auto captioning.

We work together as a team to build something that we share into the world and that people will download and use. We strive to build things that make our end-users' lives better or are useful to them in some manner. How we build a thing has effects on how fast we build, how well the thing we are building works, and how straightforward it is to build on in the future. Often we can overlook the downstream effects of our work in order to complete our tasks in a defined timeline. We should take the time to consider how taking the easy or fastest route can complicate our team’s work in the future. Our team strives to create fast, good code that deploys to high-uptime applications and services. We work to make the codebase better every time we touch it and to make the final product better as a result. Our team’s philosophy is to build in ways that are smart, accurate, skillful, articulate, safe, and understandable–and as a result: faster.

Engineering is the implementation of a product, which means that there are higher levels of consideration that we need to be aware of and practice. Engineers should always take the time to think about where their work sits within the system of things and not as if it exists in a vacuum. Second-order thinking involves solving problems and asking ourselves “What is next?” Thinking about how our changes and work interact with the larger work is paramount to building good software and not making mistakes that we could have prevented. When removing something, we should first know why it was there in the first place in order to understand its reason for being there. Only after we understand this context can we be sure that removing it won’t cause more harm than good. Chesterton’s Fence is the most common metaphor for this, but any quick search about second order thinking provides a wealth of information if you would like to improve your ability to think in this way.

It seems logical that we will eventually get back to fixing our small omissions or mistakes. This not only assumes that time will be allocated immediately to address this, but it also assumes that technical debt of this kind is value-neutral. Technical debt that is purposely accrued because you believe it can be addressed later is still technical debt. We should not accrue this debt without careful consideration, and getting work out the door is not a valid reason to accrue such debt. We should work to make sure we address the small issues and fix those inaccuracies the first time, rather than expect a teammate to come by later and clean up the debt we are creating in our code.

There are few things worse than looking at something complicated with no or almost no documentation. I have personally gone back to work from many years ago, not realizing it was mine and became extremely irritated with the code; it was not documented at all and was extremely abstract.

When we create or update reusable components and utilities, we should be pushing that work on to develop first, then pulling those changes back into the branch we are using. This is an extension of the rule about work being as atomic as possible. If we are building a thing that everyone will use, we should add it to the code base by itself then add it to our branch and build the specific use. This allows us to roll back the implementation if it breaks without removing the component from the code. Having specific use decoupled from the implementation makes debugging, identifying and addressing issues faster and safer to manage.

We should always be reviewing the changes we make to ensure we follow this guideline in order to have a usable code base. If you come across changes that seem to be violating this, you should be comfortable calling this out, explaining your diagnosis and formulating a plan to uncouple the responsibilities.

The flip side is that our logic may be flawed and that someone else can help us correct that logic in order to find new ways for us to think. Good engineers know why they are doing something.

A plan is only as good as our ability to estimate the amount of work we can accomplish in a time period. Not accomplishing tasks because we didn’t estimate correctly, or we had “hidden” work that took up our time has downstream effects on our team’s ability to make commitments to deliver. We should make sure that we are taking credit for all of our work by insisting that we always have a ticket for anything that we are doing, including discovery work. Whether it’s coding a screen, a spike for feasibility, or just googling for possible libraries we should be accounting for this work. This protects us by showing how much work we are actually doing that may not have an obvious delivery purpose. It also makes sure that we have accurate target dates for the whole project and can show progress when there may not be explicit code to point to.

When this is not the case, we should make sure that the tickets are explicit about what the output is and that we create and document the correct output. Sometimes this will be a documentation page. Sometimes this might be a writeup of our discovery or spike findings and our proposed solution. A strong engineering team is capable of many things beyond coding and we should be creating artifacts that showcase our work on non-code problems. This allows us to be creative and collaborative with the team and creates a permanent record for anyone picking up our work later that doesn’t require us to personally rehash the entire work.

The inverse of this is that we should trust that after we provide feedback that the other teams are evaluating our feedback and using it to inform their decisions. If their decisions go against what we as engineers suggested, we should accept that in all but the most limited situations.

How we work can be as important as what we work on. When engineers see an area for improvement, they should feel enabled to make process improvement suggestions. Remember that identifying the problem is only the beginning, we also need to have a plan on how to overcome the issue. Learning to create proposals and plans for implementing solutions is a very important skill for engineers as they progress in their careers, and we should be practicing those skills whenever we have the chance. We gain skills for thinking about a project above the code, we learn creative ways to solve problems and learn how to give and receive feedback from others, and then learn to incorporate that feedback into our own work to become better engineers and teammates. The idea of a player-led team starts with empowering the players to make suggestions and to learn from feedback in a safe space. While this is not a promise to implement all solutions that are offered up–sometimes ideas may not work for the project or for the context or may just not work yet. We promise to review all of the ideas and to communicate the why or why not so that we all can understand the context.

These are typically written by other teams and are not under the control of the mobile team. The service objects provide a common interface for establishing connections using Faraday (a ruby library for making network requests) and making requests to external services. They consist of two parts: the configuration. The configuration must be a subclass of Common::Client::Configuration::Base. The configuration is primarily responsible for setting values necessary for connecting to the upstream server–such as base URLs and api keys–and for establishing that connection via the connection method. In addition to determining which URLs, headers, and options to use when connecting to the upstream server, the connection method also adds a variety of middleware plugs that determine how requests and responses are processed by Faraday. Some of these plugs are very simple built-ins, such as the json plug used to process json responses and the snakecase plug used to specify that the response keys will be in snakecase format. Other plugs are custom-written within the vets-api. These plugs are all types of Faraday middleware that have the ability to modify the outbound request or process the inbound response. These plugs can raise errors. For example, if the configuration specifies a json plug but the response is not parsable json, it will raise an error. the service itself. These are subclasses of Common::Client::Base. The service object is responsible for using the connection created by the configuration to make upstream requests and for processing the responses. These service objects sometimes include user access checks and request data validity checks, which can raise errors. They often process the response by modifying status codes and by adapting data to models. They also provide some default error handling in the request method that rescues some common errors that can arise during the request and converts them into errors that are defined within the vets-api.

We are usually able to find out most of this information by talking to the product owners of these APIs or by testing the API ourselves, but we don't always receive an exhaustive list and often aren't told what all of the errors mean. These services can also change without our knowledge because they are still under active development. As a result, these external services can be a bit of a black box. Thankfully, this is improving with newer APIs, such as those provided by lighthouse, which are now being documented as part of the development process.

The error classes work in coordination with values set in config/locales/exceptions.en.yml.

ExceptionHandling needs errors to be subclasses of BaseError because it relies on methods in BaseError to respond to the client with the appropriate information. These three components are coupled. This coupling provides a great deal of value. It prevents us from recreating the error handling wheel with every new endpoint. Without it, each controller would have to have explicit handling for each potential error case. But it also comes at a cost. That cost is that it's difficult to know exactly which errors the controller can return because to know that you have to know which errors the upstream can return, which errors the service object can produce, and how those errors can be modified by the service object, error class, and ExceptionHandling. It also makes it difficult to fully test service object code in isolation, which makes it important to write thorough integration tests because ExceptionHandling can call methods on error classes that might not be called in service object unit tests. Bugs can exist in service objects and even within error classes that will not be revealed without integration testing with the ExceptionHandling class. "},{"title":"Wrapup​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Error Handling","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Architecture/ErrorHandling#wrapup","content":"Errors can arise during any portion of the request lifestyle. Errors that arise in the mobile portion of the vets-api are generally predictable. For example, we know that failure to authenticate the user will result in a 401, failure to authorize the user to access the resource will result in a 403, and a syntax error within the code itself will result in a 500. Once we leave the mobile backend, the possible errors become more difficult fully know due code complexity and coupling between our service objects, errors, and ExceptionHandling. Code outside of the mobile backend can also be changed without our knowledge, potentially removing, changing, or introducing errors. Once we make a request to an external service, the errors become even less predictable, due to a combination of poor documentation, poor interteam communication, and ongoing changes being made to the upstream code. As a result, errors may at times be possible that aren't listed in our api documentation. But much as the vets-api has ExceptionHandling to ensure that all errors encountered in the vets-api will be handled gracefully even if we don't know anything about that error, the mobile app has built-in error handling for common cases like 401 and 403 but also handles any unknown 400+ status codes so there should be no inherent problem with an occasional unexpected error. While it may not be possible to know every possible error that can occur, what is more important is that we document any errors that change behavior in the mobile app so the mobile app can be coded to handle those cases appropriately. For example, a few endpoints can return 207 with detailed messages when only partial data was received. This must be communicated to the user, so coordination is needed between frontend, backend, and product to ensure a smooth user experience. Given the inherent unknowns of the VA digital services ecosystem, fault tolerance is a critical feature of the VA mobile app. "},{"title":"Feature Flagging","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Architecture/FeatureFlagging","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Flipper​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Feature Flagging","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/Engineering/BackEnd/Architecture/FeatureFlagging#flipper","content":"We use Flipper to manage feature flags.

A simple use pattern is: Find the common location where code branches off into the multiple network calls.Wrap the methods that initiate those branches in lambdas.Pass an array of those lambdas to the gem, telling it how many threads to use and specifying that it should execute the call method on each lambda to execute it.Capture return values if needed.It is possible to rescue errors either within lambdas or around the entire parallelization code block.

Additionally, the filtering mechanism requires changes to the filtered model to enable filtering and to define the type of filtering allowed. There are also some limits to the collection's filtering logic that have prevented this library from meeting our requirements. And since both Common::Collection and many of the models we use exist outside of the mobile module, they're not easy for us to change. To address these limitations, we've created our own filtering library that borrows the same param syntax from Common::Collection but removes the requirement to make changes to the model.

At this time, our filtering system only supports two operations: eq and not_eq. Attribute/operation pairs can only be used once. In other words, you can't request filter[status][eq]=complete and filter[status][eq]=pending. This is a limitation in how params are processed by the rails app. We intend to add &quot;one of these values&quot; functionality as well as other operations later. Filters are additive. In other words, if the request contains filter[status][eq]=complete and filter[telehealth][not_eq]=true, you will receive only records where the status is complete and telehealth is not true.

They contain the external service name, start time, and end time. Maintenance windows are added to PagerDuty by other teams, and a vets-api sidekiq job polls PagerDuty and populates MaintenanceWindow database records with the response. There is an allow list of maintenance windows on GitHub that the sidekiq job uses to connect to PagerDuty and populate the maintenance windows. The mobile app requests maintenance windows via the maintenance windows controller, which searches the database for MaintenanceWindow records that end in the future and creates a ServiceGraph object to process those windows into a format that is more easily used by the front-end. The ServiceGraph is an abstraction that accepts a list of arguments that define a hierarchy that matches upstream services to downstream features and returns a list of upcoming Mobile::MaintenanceWindow records that have upcoming outages. Note that Mobile::MaintenanceWindows are different than MaintenanceWindows but contain the same basic data with service names that are specific to mobile app features. This allows the mobile team to define its own mapping of services to features. Each argument is an array of two symbols in which the first element is an upstream service or intermediate service and the second key is either an intermediate service or the feature name that would be received by the mobile app. Intermediate services are not included in the results, only terminal nodes (i.e., second items in the array that do not match the first items of any subsequent arrays). An example ServiceGraph instance could be something like: Mobile::V0::ServiceGraph.new( %i[bgs evss], %i[vet360 military_service_history], %i[evss claims], %i[evss direct_deposit_benefits] )  This gets processed into a hierarchy like: { bgs: [claims, direct_deposit_benefits], evss: [claims, direct_deposit_benefits], vet360: [military_service_history] }  So if there's an upcoming maintenance window for either bgs or evss, the ServiceGraph would return an array of Mobile::MaintenanceWindow objects including start and end times for claims and direct_deposit_benefits. If there's an upcoming maintenance window for vet360, it would return mobile maintenance window data for military_service_history.

They're defined in json files within the vets-api that define the shape of the data that is expected to be received from the external service. The contract specifies which data fields are expected and the data types of the values. Contracts will typically exist per endpoint or resource that is being consumed. For example, the appointments index and immunizations index will require different contracts because the underlying resources are different. Whereas the appointments index and appointment show endpoints return the same resource but will require different contracts because the index will expect an array of appointments while the show will expect a single appointment. However, it is possible for contracts to be applied to multiple endpoints if their format is expected to be identical.

If the response was successful, the library checks the database to see if a contract test record for that contract has been created yet for the current day. If no record exists, it creates one with the response body and initiates a background job for validating the response against the schema. When the background job is executed, it looks up the newly created record and compares the saved response against the contract. If any errors are found, they are raised with a detailed error message to alert developers to investigate. The database record is then updated to include the error details and status of the comparison (i.e., success or schema errors found) to provide a persistent papertrail for debugging.

A GitHub Action runs every Tuesday morning to check and see if there is a staged build ready for developer release in the Apple App Store. For Play Store, it checks to see if there is a newer build than the production lane waiting in the Pre-Prod Stash lane. If there is, they are released to production at that time and sends a message to the main va-mobile-app channel in DSVA slack. If not, it completes silently. Release branches are cut by an Action every other Wednesday that follows a release. The release branch acts as a freeze on the develop branch for the next release that allows QA to run regressions from a static point and allows any last-minute changes to be added before being merged to main and build for review in the stores. This release branch being created then starts automation that creates the release ticket in GitHub and assigns the relevant people. Releases coincide with the last day of a sprint and new release branches are cut on the first day of the sprint. Release process approval ends with an authorized person (currently a VA Product Owner) releasing the app for build and upload to the stores by running the /approve command in the automated release ticket. This is accomplish by adding a comment to the issue in the form of /approve vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z is the next version number. This version number should be present in the title of the ticket. Once the release is approved, the build system will create and upload production versions of the app to the App Stores for review. Barring any issues, these should be released on the next Tuesday when the release Action runs. note Because chrontab notation doesn't have a way to schedule a job at an interval , i.e. every two weeks, the release action has to be scheduled for EVERY Tuesday. This means that if the approve command is run before the Tuesday in the middle of the sprint, the releases will go out a week early.

This type of build is usually for very specific builds the developer wants to distribute to other tracks in Test Flight and Play Store. It is also here as a back-up in case the automated build system experiences issues. This allows for manual kick-off of a build, but guarantees that the build will be, at minimum, configured and built correctly.

You can see that the yellow branch will have started and be missing two gray commits that the blue branch will have because of where it was based.  This means we need to pay attention the to base branch when we make new branches. In most cases, you will probably have two cases to choose from: I am making new changes that need to get added to the app or wherever, but NOT for the release ticket. For these you will likely need to base off of the develop branch.I am making change FOR a release ticket, such as what’s new or content changes that have to be in the next release.

Downtime messages use the same display pattern as errors in code, with additional checks in the useError utility to check if a downtime error exists for a specific screen ID. Multiple features can trigger a downtime message on a single screen, e.g. claims and appeals are two separate features but display on the same page.

In this example, the path of the deep link is prefixed with vamobile://, starts with messages, and is followed by the MSG_ID parameter, which is a field that will be populated from the API call that triggers the push notification.

Route names in config can also nest other screens objects for child routes. For reference, the configuration can look something like this: config: { screens: { Tabs: { screens: { HealthTab: { screens: { ViewMessageScreen: 'messages/:messageID', }, }, }, }, }, }  You'll notice the entry for the screen ViewMessageScreen is nested under other screens like HealthTab and Tabs. This reflects the structure of the app's navigation stack. Starting from the root navigator, you can trace the stack by viewing the component prop of the route in the stack until you arrive at the screen you want. Using the example above, the Tabs route is mapped to the AppTabs component, which is where most of the screens in the app fall under. In the AppTabs component, you'll see a navigation stack containing the HealthTab route, which maps to the HealthScreen screen. In the HealthScreen component, you'll see a navigation stack containing all the health screens. From that list, you'll find the ViewMessageScreen route, which finally maps to the ViewMessageScreen component.

Navigating back from screens opened via a deep link will typically go back to the home screen. This is because React Navigation isn't able to automatically generate the correct navigation state when a deep link is opened. The navigation state will need to be manually generated to ensure navigating back after opening a deep link takes the user to the correct screen. In the linking configuration, the getStateFromPath function can be used for manually setting the navigation state based on the path of the opened deep link. Logic added here shouldn't conflict with logic for other deep links. The generated navigation state for ViewMessageScreen from the previous examples looks like this: { routes: [ { name: 'Tabs', state: { routes: [ { name: 'HealthTab', state: { routes: [{ name: 'Health' }, { name: 'SecureMessaging' }, { name: 'ViewMessageScreen', params: { messageID: pathParts[1] } }], }, }, ], }, }, ], }  The state should match the behavior you'd see if you were manually navigating from the home screen to the desired screen. The navigation state should be returned by the function if the path parameter matches the pattern specified in the config object. This will ensure that navigating back from the screen opened by a push notification produces expected behavior. More information on navigation state can be found in the React Navigation documentation.

The VANotify API can also be used to send push notifications to a device, but this requires an API key that will need to be provided by the VANotify team. Note: Remote push notifications will only work on a physical device with a non-development build installed, so you'll need to run an on demand build for your branch.

This approach will work with a virtual device. To test your deep link, you can run the following command in your terminal: npx uri-scheme open &quot;{THE_FULL_URL}&quot; --{DEVICE_PLATFORM}  This will launch the app with the provided URL, similar to how a push notification with deep linking configured would. Using the example from earlier, running this for the iOS simulator would look something like: npx uri-scheme open &quot;vamobile://messages/1234&quot; --ios  Detox​ You can also use our automated UI testing tool Detox to simulate push notifications on a virtual device. Detox supports mocking push notifications, which provides a more complete view of how the app will behave when a deep link is opened from a push notification. Since Detox is already used in our repository, all you'll need to do is create a new test for your push notification, and run it locally. View an example of a Detox test for a push notification.

The name that you give to the reducer will be the same name the action creator and type is going to use typescript will infere that name. /src/store/slices/militaryServiceSlice.ts import { PayloadAction, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit' export type MilitaryServiceState = { serviceHistory: api.ServiceHistoryData loading: boolean error?: Error mostRecentBranch?: string needsDataLoad: boolean preloadComplete: boolean } export const initialMilitaryServiceState: MilitaryServiceState = { serviceHistory: [] as api.ServiceHistoryData, loading: false, needsDataLoad: true, preloadComplete: false, } const militaryServiceSlice = createSlice({ name: 'militaryService', initialState: initialMilitaryServiceState, reducers: { dispatchStartGetHistory: (state) =&gt; { state.loading = true }, dispatchFinishGetHistory: (state, action: PayloadAction&lt;{ serviceHistory?: api.ServiceHistoryData; error?: Error }&gt;) =&gt; { const { serviceHistory, error } = action.payload const history = serviceHistory || state.serviceHistory const latestHistory = max(history, (historyItem) =&gt; { return getDateFromString(historyItem.endDate) }) as ServiceData return { ...state, error, mostRecentBranch: latestHistory?.branchOfService, serviceHistory: history, loading: false, needsDataLoad: !!error, preloadComplete: true, } }, }, }) info The PayloadAction param only takes one value if you need to pass more than one param use an object as above. Also the reducer functions created inside the slice uses the Immer package. Which allows you to write mutated code as the dispatchStartGetHistory reducer function above. You can also return an immutable object as the dispatchFinishGetHistory function above.

The ideal quantity of test coverage depends on component type. Examining component types from most coverage to least: Shared components are isolated bundles of code which many other components consume. Because shared components are widely used, unit tests should exercise them very thoroughly, including checking all edge cases and error states. (Maximum coverage)Screen child components are usually not shared and are tightly bound to other components in the screen. Unit tests for these child components should focus on complicated logic that's prone to regressions, while avoiding duplicate coverage between parent and child components. Tests should cover edge cases and error states, but need not check every possible combination of props and state. (High coverage)Entire screens are typically complex, integrating multiple components along with Redux state, routing, and 3rd party modules. We lean on E2E tests to fully cover screens, so unit tests for screens should be limited in scope to avoid duplicating E2E test coverage. Also if a child component of a screen already has its own unit tests, there's no need to duplicate those tests in the screen itself. (Medium coverage) Note that while a high coverage percentage is good, it doesn't ensure tests are complete and correct. It's important to think critically and implement tests that cover the key cases a user might encounter.

If a new component is exclusive to the VAHB app and will not become part of the design system, the Flagship team member should move forward with detailed documentation of the component. When possible, please align with the current documentation outline that is being used by the design system team for consistency (see the button component as an example). note Guidance on writing documentation and templates for the documentation are included in the “Documentation resources” section below. If the new component will eventually live within the design system, please coordinate with the Design System team so that they can update the design system documentation with the new component.

Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}} NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views. id\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing\tboolean No\tWhether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background). Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU. onLayout\t(event: LayoutChangeEvent) =&gt; void No\tInvoked on mount and layout changes with {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}. pointerEvents\t&quot;none&quot; | &quot;box-none&quot; | &quot;box-only&quot; | &quot;auto&quot; No\tIn the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class: .box-none { pointer-events: none; } .box-none * { pointer-events: all; } box-only is the equivalent of .box-only { pointer-events: all; } .box-only * { pointer-events: none; } But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes, we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform. removeClippedSubviews\tboolean No\tThis is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound. The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews). style\tStyleProp&lt;ViewStyle&gt; No testID\tstring No\tUsed to locate this view in end-to-end tests. Optional TestID nativeID\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. collapsable\tboolean No\tViews that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy. collapsableChildren\tboolean No\tSetting to false prevents direct children of the view from being removed from the native view hierarchy, similar to the effect of setting `collapsable={false}` on each child. renderToHardwareTextureAndroid\tboolean No\tWhether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU. On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation. focusable\tboolean No\tWhether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. tabIndex\t0 | -1 No\tIndicates whether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex for more details. Supports the following values: - 0 (View is focusable) - -1 (View is not focusable) shouldRasterizeIOS\tboolean No\tWhether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing. On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame. Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property. isTVSelectable\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable and navigable using the Apple TV remote. @platform ios hasTVPreferredFocus\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceX\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release onResponderTerminate\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe responder has been taken from the View. Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS) onStartShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable. However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true. onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first.

You may also use string shortcuts `&quot;normal&quot;` and `&quot;fast&quot;` which match the underlying iOS settings for `UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal` and `UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast` respectively. - `'normal'`: 0.998 on iOS, 0.985 on Android (the default) - `'fast'`: 0.99 on iOS, 0.9 on Android horizontal\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false. invertStickyHeaders\tboolean No\tIf sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews. keyboardDismissMode\t&quot;none&quot; | &quot;interactive&quot; | &quot;on-drag&quot; No\tDetermines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag. - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard. - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins. - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the dismissal. keyboardShouldPersistTaps\tboolean | &quot;always&quot; | &quot;never&quot; | &quot;handled&quot; No\tDetermines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap. - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap. - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps. - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor). - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead onContentSizeChange\t(w: number, h: number) =&gt; void No\tCalled when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes. Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight) It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders. onScroll\t(event: NativeSyntheticEvent&lt;NativeScrollEvent&gt;) =&gt; void No\tFires at most once per frame during scrolling. onScrollBeginDrag\t(event: NativeSyntheticEvent&lt;NativeScrollEvent&gt;) =&gt; void No\tFires if a user initiates a scroll gesture. onScrollEndDrag\t(event: NativeSyntheticEvent&lt;NativeScrollEvent&gt;) =&gt; void No\tFires when a user has finished scrolling. onMomentumScrollEnd\t(event: NativeSyntheticEvent&lt;NativeScrollEvent&gt;) =&gt; void No\tFires when scroll view has finished moving onMomentumScrollBegin\t(event: NativeSyntheticEvent&lt;NativeScrollEvent&gt;) =&gt; void No\tFires when scroll view has begun moving pagingEnabled\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default value is false. scrollEnabled\tboolean No\tWhen false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true removeClippedSubviews\tboolean No\tExperimental: When true offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen. This can improve scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is false. showsHorizontalScrollIndicator\tboolean No\tWhen true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator. showsVerticalScrollIndicator\tboolean No\tWhen true, shows a vertical scroll indicator. stickyHeaderHiddenOnScroll\tboolean No\tWhen true, Sticky header is hidden when scrolling down, and dock at the top when scrolling up. style\tStyleProp&lt;ViewStyle&gt; No\tStyle refreshControl\tReactElement&lt;RefreshControlProps, string | JSXElementConstructor&lt;any&gt;&gt; No\tA RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh functionality for the ScrollView. snapToInterval\tnumber No\tWhen set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`. This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=&quot;fast&quot;`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` prop. snapToOffsets\tnumber[] No\tWhen set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=&quot;fast&quot;`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props. snapToStart\tboolean No\tUse in conjunction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true. snapToEnd\tboolean No\tUse in conjunction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true. stickyHeaderIndices\tnumber[] No\tAn array of child indices determining which children get docked to the top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. disableIntervalMomentum\tboolean No\tWhen true, the scroll view stops on the next index (in relation to scroll position at release) regardless of how fast the gesture is. This can be used for horizontal pagination when the page is less than the width of the ScrollView. The default value is false. disableScrollViewPanResponder\tboolean No\tWhen true, the default JS pan responder on the ScrollView is disabled, and full control over touches inside the ScrollView is left to its child components. This is particularly useful if `snapToInterval` is enabled, since it does not follow typical touch patterns. Do not use this on regular ScrollView use cases without `snapToInterval` as it may cause unexpected touches to occur while scrolling. The default value is false. StickyHeaderComponent\tComponentType&lt;any&gt; No\tA React Component that will be used to render sticky headers, should be used together with stickyHeaderIndices. You may need to set this component if your sticky header uses custom transforms, for example, when you want your list to have an animated and hidable header. If component have not been provided, the default ScrollViewStickyHeader component will be used. hitSlop\tnumber | Insets No\tThis defines how far a touch event can start away from the view. Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}} NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views. id\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing\tboolean No\tWhether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background). Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU. onLayout\t(event: LayoutChangeEvent) =&gt; void No\tInvoked on mount and layout changes with {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}. pointerEvents\t&quot;none&quot; | &quot;box-none&quot; | &quot;box-only&quot; | &quot;auto&quot; No\tIn the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class: .box-none { pointer-events: none; } .box-none * { pointer-events: all; } box-only is the equivalent of .box-only { pointer-events: all; } .box-only * { pointer-events: none; } But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes, we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform. testID\tstring No\tUsed to locate this view in end-to-end tests. nativeID\tstring No\tUsed to reference react managed views from native code. collapsable\tboolean No\tViews that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy. collapsableChildren\tboolean No\tSetting to false prevents direct children of the view from being removed from the native view hierarchy, similar to the effect of setting `collapsable={false}` on each child. renderToHardwareTextureAndroid\tboolean No\tWhether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU. On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation. focusable\tboolean No\tWhether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. tabIndex\t0 | -1 No\tIndicates whether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex for more details. Supports the following values: - 0 (View is focusable) - -1 (View is not focusable) shouldRasterizeIOS\tboolean No\tWhether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing. On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame. Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property. isTVSelectable\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable and navigable using the Apple TV remote. @platform ios hasTVPreferredFocus\tboolean No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceX\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 2.0. @platform ios tvParallaxShiftDistanceY\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 2.0. @platform ios tvParallaxTiltAngle\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 0.05. @platform ios tvParallaxMagnification\tnumber No\t*(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus. Defaults to 1.0. @platform ios onStartShouldSetResponder\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tDoes this view want to become responder on the start of a touch? onMoveShouldSetResponder\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tCalled for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to &quot;claim&quot; touch responsiveness? onResponderEnd\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tIf the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen: onResponderGrant\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening onResponderReject\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tSomething else is the responder right now and will not release it onResponderMove\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe user is moving their finger onResponderRelease\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tFired at the end of the touch, ie &quot;touchUp&quot; onResponderStart\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No onResponderTerminationRequest\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tSomething else wants to become responder. Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release onResponderTerminate\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; void No\tThe responder has been taken from the View. Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS) onStartShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable. However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true. onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture\t(event: GestureResponderEvent) =&gt; boolean No\tonStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable. However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.

The provided string value must follow the BCP 47 specification (https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47). https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylanguage-ios @platform ios alwaysBounceHorizontal\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise. alwaysBounceVertical\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise. automaticallyAdjustContentInsets\tboolean No\tControls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar. The default value is true. automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets\tboolean No\tControls whether the ScrollView should automatically adjust its contentInset and scrollViewInsets when the Keyboard changes its size. The default value is false. automaticallyAdjustsScrollIndicatorInsets\tboolean No\tControls whether iOS should automatically adjust the scroll indicator insets. The default value is true. Available on iOS 13 and later. bounces\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true. bouncesZoom\tboolean No\tWhen true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed the limits. canCancelContentTouches\tboolean No\tWhen false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves. The default value is true. centerContent\tboolean No\tWhen true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default value is false. contentInset\tInsets No\tThe amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view. Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}. contentOffset\tPointProp No\tUsed to manually set the starting scroll offset. The default value is {x: 0, y: 0} contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior\t&quot;always&quot; | &quot;never&quot; | &quot;automatic&quot; | &quot;scrollableAxes&quot; No\tThis property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view. The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51. directionalLockEnabled\tboolean No\tWhen true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal scrolling while dragging. The default value is false. indicatorStyle\t&quot;default&quot; | &quot;black&quot; | &quot;white&quot; No\tThe style of the scroll indicators. - default (the default), same as black. - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against a white content background. - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against a black content background. maintainVisibleContentPosition\t{ autoscrollToTopThreshold?: number; minIndexForVisible: number; } No\tWhen set, the scroll view will adjust the scroll position so that the first child that is currently visible and at or beyond minIndexForVisible will not change position. This is useful for lists that are loading content in both directions, e.g. a chat thread, where new messages coming in might otherwise cause the scroll position to jump. A value of 0 is common, but other values such as 1 can be used to skip loading spinners or other content that should not maintain position. The optional autoscrollToTopThreshold can be used to make the content automatically scroll to the top after making the adjustment if the user was within the threshold of the top before the adjustment was made. This is also useful for chat-like applications where you want to see new messages scroll into place, but not if the user has scrolled up a ways and it would be disruptive to scroll a bunch. Caveat 1: Reordering elements in the scrollview with this enabled will probably cause jumpiness and jank. It can be fixed, but there are currently no plans to do so. For now, don't re-order the content of any ScrollViews or Lists that use this feature. Caveat 2: This uses contentOffset and frame.origin in native code to compute visibility. Occlusion, transforms, and other complexity won't be taken into account as to whether content is &quot;visible&quot; or not. maximumZoomScale\tnumber No\tThe maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0. minimumZoomScale\tnumber No\tThe minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0. onScrollAnimationEnd\t() =&gt; void No\tCalled when a scrolling animation ends. pinchGestureEnabled\tboolean No\tWhen true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out. The default value is true. scrollEventThrottle\tnumber No\tLimits how often scroll events will be fired while scrolling, specified as a time interval in ms. This may be useful when expensive work is performed in response to scrolling. Values &lt;= `16` will disable throttling, regardless of the refresh rate of the device. scrollIndicatorInsets\tInsets No\tThe amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view. This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.

Acceptance criteria (AC) are written as part of the user story and describe the conditions that must be met in order for the story to be accepted as complete.\tProduct Test Cases &amp; Functional Testing\tTest cases are defined by the QA team and are written not only to make sure all stories and their acceptance criteria are met but will also account for edge cases (scenarios that happen outside of normal operating conditions) like attempting to upload the wrong file type or entering text characters into a date field. Test cases are used to perform manual functional testing in which QA interacts with the application as would an end user to identify any issues.\tQA Unit Testing\tUnit tests are written into the code by developers and target the smallest components of the code that can be logically isolated from the rest of the system. These tests are typically fast and can run any time the code is changed to help identify and isolate defects during development. The purpose of unit tests is to make sure the code functions are defect-free before merging into the larger code base.\tDevelopers Integration Testing\tIn contrast to unit tests, integration tests run across individual modules of code to validate that separately developed modules are working together properly. Integration tests are also used to validate that the VA Mobile App front end interfaces with other systems and services, such as the VA.gov APIs, as designed.\tDevelopers End-to-end Testing\tEnd-to-end testing, or system testing, looks to validate that the system as a whole works as intended. These tests are similar in nature to integration tests but are focused on the superset of delivered software and its connections to other systems. End-to-end testing will be done prior to release and will consist of both manual and automated testing to ensure adequate coverage of the delivered functionality.\tDevelopers, QA, Product User Acceptance Testing\tUser Acceptance Testing, sometimes referred to as &quot;UAT&quot; or just Acceptance Testing, involves the product team and other stakeholders interacting with the application to simulate real-world usage and signing off that the delivered software functions as defined in the designs and requirements. We will leverage pre-production distribution tools such as TestFlight to get the app in the hands of stakeholders to facilitate Acceptance Testing.\tProduct, Stakeholder community Accessibility Testing\tAccessibility is a major requirement for the VA Mobile App and requires additional consideration beyond the standard testing process. QA will include accessibility checks in the manual functional testing activities. For a more detailed plan on accessibility testing approach see the Mobile Accessibility Testing Plan.\tDevelopers, QA Compatibility Testing\tSoftware may behave differently depending on the specific device and operating system that it is running on. In order to validate that the software developed will work as intended across a variety of devices we will also perform manual functional testing of each feature on a variety of physical devices and OSs as defined on the compatibility page.\t "},{"title":"Testing accounts and data​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Quality Assurance Process","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/QA/QualityAssuranceProcess/#testing-accounts-and-data","content":"In order to support testing activities we will need test user accounts with test data that is representative of the variations anticipated in production user data.

Prior to the update, we would have asked a sighted participant to locate the app icon with the white &quot;VA&quot; and blue background, however, a participant's app icon may no longer visually appear this way. On Android devices, it is also common for a user to customize the appearance of their app icons, font styles, etc. using shortcuts or apperance customization apps. Instead of relying on the app icon's appearance to describe and verify that the participant has the VA: Health and Benefits app installed, you should consider building a few extra minutes into your research study plan to verify that the participant has the correct app by asking them to open the app and visually look at the splash / login screen in their screen share to verify. If Perigean will be verifying this for you, notify your recruiter that they will need to request that the Veteran open the app and visually verify that they have the correct app installed. You should also consider supplying screenshots of the login screen to the recruiter in both dark and light modes, so that they have it to make the visual comparison themselves.

To disable screen curtain on an Android device, the participant should: Triple-tap the screen once to open the TalkBack menu. Note: On some devices, the gesture to open the TalkBack menu may not be available or may not work.

The participant should listen for an option that might impact the visibility of the device screen. Alternatively, they might also be ale to activate their voice assistant (Google Assistant, Bixby, etc.) and instruct the voice assistant to show their screen, disable screen shade/curtain, etc. This step will depend on the participant's Android device, but after they have located the option for the screen curtain / shade, they should follow any necessary steps to show their screen / disable screen curtain. This could be a simple double-tap gesture to show the screen or could take them to their TalkBack settings where they may need to toggle off the screen curtain. Note: It is recommended that you ask the participant to talk you through the steps that they are taking to disable the screen shade / curtain and that you (or an observer) make a quick note so that you can help them reactivate it at the end of the session.

Category\tWCAG / 508 Section\tImplementation ApproachColor\tColor contrast (1.4.3_AA) (1.4.6_AAA)\tDesigns for the the app should consider the following: Normal fonts (&lt; 19px) AA compliant: 4.5:1AAA compliant: 7:1 Large fonts (19px +) AA compliant: 3:1AAA compliant: 4.5:1 Color\tColor (1.4.1_A)\tDesigns for the app should not use color as the sole conveyance of information. Color\tNon-text contrast (1.4.11_AA)\tDesigns of UI components and graphical objects in the app designs that are used to understand the content should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. Headings &amp; Navigation\tHeading levels (1.3.1_A)\tDesigns for each page should have a single h1 and additional headings (h2 - h6) for each section of the page. There are no skipped heading levels. (i.e. the headings don't jump from h1 to h&gt;). Programmatically specify ARIA level for all text headings in React Native. Headings &amp; Navigation\tInfo and Relationships (1.3.1_A) (502.3.7) (502.3.8)\tLeverage React Native accessible components so that information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. Headings &amp; Navigation\tTables (1.3.1_A) (502.3.3)\tAll tables should be programmatically identified and the table heading for applicable rows and columns should be announced. N/A: There are currently no complex tables in the designs. If we need to pull in a fancier table than what we can build with react native list views, then we may need to pull in a third party library that is accessible and meets the designs. Headings &amp; Navigation\tLists (1.3.1_A)\tLeverage React Native accessible list component so lists can be programmatically determined. Headings &amp; Navigation\tPage title (2.4.2_A)\tEach page on the app should programmatically have a unique title that is descriptive and differentiated. React Native may provide libraries that facilitate this. Headings &amp; Navigation\tHeadings and labels (2.4.6_AA)\tHeadings and labels should describe the topic or purpose and be programmatically determined as such. Headings &amp; Navigation\tNavigation consistency (3.2.3_AA)\tDesigns for navigation mechanisms that are repeated across several pages should be consistent. (Color, icon, text, location, etc.) Headings &amp; Navigation\tSensory characteristics (1.3.3_A) (502.3.8)\tDesigns for pages should not require sensory characteristics such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound to be understood or operable. Headings &amp; Navigation\tBypass Blocks (Skip nav) (2.4.1_A) (c205.2.2)\tProvide a means of skipping repeating content (e.g. headers, navigation, bars, etc.). N/A according to section 508 (c205.2.2) and no such navigation exists in the app. Headings &amp; Navigation\tLink purpose in context (2.4.4_A)\tDesign so that the purpose of each link can be determined by its text (e.g. &quot;Schedule your appointment now&quot;) or the context it's surrounded by (e.g. &quot;There are a lot of ways to stay active during the pandemic.&quot;). &quot;Click / tap here&quot; should never be used.

N/A according to section 508 (c205.2.2) since this is a non-web format. Non-text content &amp; media\tText alternatives (1.1.1_A)\tProvide text alternatives for any non-text content (e.g. images, non-decorative icons, etc.) so that it can be read by a screen reader or translated into large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language. Non-text content &amp; media\tText alternatives for audio-only and video-only content (1.2.1_A)\tContent / API should provide text alternatives for all audio and video content. N/A – No such content exists in the app. Non-text content &amp; media\tAudio descriptions (1.2.5_AA) (503.4.2)\tAudio descriptions should be provided for all pre-recorded video content. N/A – No such content exists in the app. Non-text content &amp; media\tVideo &amp; live video captions (1.2.2_A &amp; 1.2.4_AA) (503.4.1)\tContent / API should provide captions for pre-recorded and live video content. N/A – Use native audio / video player from OS if needed and possible. Non-text content &amp; media\tAudio controls (1.4.2_A) (503.4)\tDesign so that all audio content has a mechanism to start, stop and adjust volume independent of the system. N/A – Use native audio / video player from OS if needed and possible. Non-text content &amp; media\tPause, stop, hide - Video &amp; animation controls (2.2.2_A)\tDesign so that all media content has a mechanism to start, stop and hide. N/A – Use native audio / video player from OS if needed and possible. Non-text content &amp; media\tFlashing content (2.3.1_A)\tDesigns should not include content or UI elements that flash more than 3 times per second. Avoid flashing content altogether, if possible. Non-text content &amp; media\tLabel in name (2.5.3_A) (502.3.6)\tDesign UI components with a visual label and ensure that the label is programmatically available in the beginning of the name of the component. Non-text content &amp; media\tIdentify Input Purpose - Form labels and instructions (1.3.5_AA &amp; 3.3.2_A) (502.3.6) (502.3.9) (502.3.12)\tLeverage React Native accessible form components so the purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined. Non-text content &amp; media\tForm error identification (3.3.1_A)\tLeverage React Native accessible form components so that any errors in filling out a form should be designed descriptive, clearly visible and read programmatically. Non-text content &amp; media\tInput triggers (3.2.2_A)\tDesigns for the app when changing an input should not cause major changes in page content (i.e. forewarn users if their context will change based on their input). Non-text content &amp; media\tForm error suggestions (3.3.3_AA)\tDesigns for the app should include error messages that include suggestions on how to fix the error. Leverage React Native accessible form components so suggestions can be read programmatically. Non-text content &amp; media\tLegal, financial and data error prevention (3.3.4_AA)\tDesigns for the app should enable users to be able to reverse, check or confirm inputs for important data. Text content\tMeaningful reading order (1.3.2_A)\tDesigns for the app should make sure everything is read in an order that makes sense and is programmatically read. Occasionally, iOS will override the order that elements are read on the screen when using Switch Control / Voice Access or a keyboard. QA will test for this and attempt to find a solution, but this is not always possible to fix. Text content\tImages of text (1.4.5_AA) (502.3.8)\tDesigns should not use images that are purely text, unless its visual style cannot be accomplished via styled text (e.g. logo text). Text content\tText spacing (1.4.12_AA)\tDesign and set up text styles so that: Line height / spacing is at least 1.5 times the font sizeParagraph spacing is at least 2 times the font sizeLetter spacing is at least 0.12 times the font size for serif and slab-serif fontsWord spacing is at least 0.16 times the font size for serif and slab-serif fonts Text content\tText Resizing (1.4.4_AA)\tDesign so that it’s possible to resize content significantly (ideally to the max device size). Programmatically, all fonts should scale with the font scaling the user has set in the OS. Please note that on certain device sizes, when a user has display zoom enabled on their device, we can only accommodate text size increases to an extent. Content may become cut off or break out of containers. There is no known fix at this time. Content may also become cut off in native components (usually Android) such as alert boxes when the text size is increased. Using shorter headings and descriptions is recommended to help alleviate this. Text content\tRedundant Entry (3.3.7_A)\tDesign so that information previously entered by or provided to the user that is required to be entered again in the same process is either: auto-populated, oravailable for the user to select. Except when: re-entering the information is essential,the information is required to ensure the security of the content, orpreviously entered information is no longer valid. N/A – No such content exists in the app. Miscellaneous\tContent on Hover or Focus (1.4.13_AA)\tProgrammatically ensure that where content is suddenly visible, then not visible (e.g. a tool-tip) newly shown content is dismissible, hoverable and persistent. This specifically refers to actions that remove pointer hover or when the keyboard focus triggers additional content. Miscellaneous\tFocus Appearance (2.4.13_AAA)\tProgrammatically ensure that when the focus indicator is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following: is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, andhas a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states Exceptions: The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the author, orThe focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author. N/A due to exceptions (focus indicators are determined by the OS in the app). Miscellaneous\tFocus Not Obscured (2.4.11_AAA)\tProgrammatically ensure that when a UI component receives focus, no part of the component is hidden by author-created content (e.g. the footer navigation bar). Miscellaneous\tReflow (1.4.10_AA)\tProgrammatically ensure that content doesn't require horizontal scrolling when resizing. Miscellaneous\tTime limits (2.2.1_A)\tProgrammatically ensure that time limits set by the content must be able to be turned off, adjusted, extended, or be longer than 20 hours. If the time limit is essential to the experience, then it is exempt. Miscellaneous\tStatus Messages (4.1.3_A) (502.3.14)\tProgrammatically ensure that users are aware of status changes by declaring status messages through roles or properties. For instance, ensuring that &quot;invalid entry&quot;, &quot;saved&quot;, or &quot;submitted&quot; is communicated to the user. Design should also communicate a change in status. Miscellaneous\tDragging Movements (2.5.7_AA)\tProgrammatically ensure that all functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential or the functionality is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author. For example, a map should allow users to drag the view of the map around, and the map has up/down/left/right buttons to move the view as well. Design should also avoid creating components where dragging is required. Miscellaneous\tConsistent Help (3.2.6_A)\tDesign should ensure that if any of the following help mechanisms exist and those mechanisms are repeated on multiple screens, they occur in the same relative order to other screen content, unless a change is initiated by the user: Human contact details;Human contact mechanism;Self-help option;A fully automated contact mechanism. N/A – No such content exists in the app. Miscellaneous\tAccessible Authentication (Enhanced) (3.3.8_AAA)\tProgrammatically ensure that a cognitive function test (e.g. remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of the following: Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test. Device specific\tTarget Size (2.5.5_AAA)\tDesign should ensure that target pointer / touch inputs are at least 44px by 44px. Programmatically, React Native accessible components on tap targets will be leveraged. Device specific\tDevice orientation (1.3.4_AA)\tDesign should ensure that the UI supports portrait and landscape mode. Device specific\tPointer gestures (2.5.1_A) (503.2)\tDesign so that no inputs require gestures and are possible with taps. All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential. Assumption: The only feature that will not have a tap-based alternative is scrolling, and this can be supported by platform capabilities. Both platforms have alternatives available to perform simple gestures (e.g. iOS has Assistive Touch built in.) Device specific\tPointer cancelation (2.5.2_A)\tProgrammatically ensure that for functionality that can be operated using a single pointer (or tap), at least one of the following is true: The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;Completing the function on the down-event is essential. Device specific\tMotion Actuation (2.5.4_A)\tFor a feature that requires device motion (e.g. Face ID), design an alternative way to use that feature that doesn't require device motion. Assumption: A login username and password field is an alternative for Face ID. We are also assuming that taking a picture for document upload is an essential function that can’t be done in an alternative way. Code\tPage language (3.1.1_A)\tThe default human language of the app should be programmatically determined. Please note: We should be very strategic about our pronunciation overrides. It is generally recommended that you not override the screen reader’s pronunciation and that if a correction is needed, we should try not to overcorrect. However, special cases like forcing “mb” to read out as “megabytes” do occur and should be overridden in all instances. Code\tName, role, value (4.1.2_A) (502.3.1) (502.3.2) (502.3.4) (502.3.5) (502.3.14)\tAll custom UI components (e.g. form elements, links, components, etc.) should programmatically have a name, role and value. Design and the accessibility specialist should work with engineering to determine the best name for custom components. Keyboard\tKeyboard focus visibility (2.4.7) (502.3.12)\tProgrammatically ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities. If an element is in focus, it should be clearly visible that it is. Keyboard\tKeyboard focus order (2.4.3_A) (502.3.10)\tThe tab order should make logical sense. All focusable elements should be read aloud by a screen reader. The tab order cannot be programmatically adjusted through React Native as it does not support indexing, therefore the tab order will be dependent on the visual order. However, we could index components using AccessibilityLabel over the indexes of the map over an array of data. Occasionally, iOS will override the focus order when using a keyboard. QA will test for this and attempt to find a solution, but this is not always possible to fix. Keyboard\tKeyboard access (2.1.1_A) (502.3.11) (502.3.13)\tProgrammatically ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities. All functionality of the content should be operable when using a keyboard. Keyboard\tKeyboard traps (2.1.2_A) (502.3.13)\tProgrammatically ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities. Content should not “trap” keyboard focus (i.e. provide ways to exit modals and widgets using the keyboard). Keyboard\tCharacter Key Shortcuts (2.1.4_A)\tProgrammatically ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities. Keyboard shortcuts must be able to be turned off, remapped or active only if the component is in focus. Keyboard\tFocus triggers (3.2.1_A)\tProgrammatically ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities. Changing focus should not trigger any unexpected changes to page content.

[F] The label name is not included in the accessible name or this content is repeated by the screen reader. Identify Input Purpose - Form labels and instructions\tUse the screen reader and visual observation to ensure all fields collecting information are well labeled so the user can easily tell what is needed.\t[P] Purpose for each input field for information collection from the user is easily determined. [F] Input field does not clearly convey the information needed. Form error identification\tUse the screen reader and visual observation to verify that any form entry or submission errors are clearly conveyed to the user. In cases where the app automatically corrects an entered value, the constraint is also communicated.\t[P] Screen reader clearly informs users of errors that have occurred during entry or submission. [F] Error messages do not exist, or the screen reader fails to read errors appearing during entry or submission. Input triggers\tVisually observe that filling out form fields will not change the content of the page or form in any major way and that any change that does occur is communicated to the user.\t[P] Filling in a form causes no changes in page content. [P] Filling in a form causes a minor change in page content, but is communicated to a user.

[F] The user is unable to do any of the aforementioned actions and all legal and financial data inputs are final. Meaningful Reading Order\tUse the screen reader to ensure page content is read in a logical order. Occasionally, iOS will override the focus order when using Switch Control / Voice Access or keyboard. QA should test for this and attempt to find a solution, but this is not always possible to fix.\t[P] Content is read in a logical order. [F] Content is not read in a logical order and jumps around. Images of Text\tUse visual observation to verify images are not purely text.

Text Resizing\tUse the OS font scaling settings to verify the user is able to resize content to the maximum device size. Note: The header and navigation bar will not be reviewed for this criteria, as resizing these components significantly would make them unusable. On certain device sizes, when a user has display zoom enabled on their device, we can only accommodate text size increases to an extent. Content may become cut off or break out of containers. There is no known fix at this time. Content may also become cut off in native components (usually Android) such as alert boxes when the text size is increased. If this occurs, a recommendation may be made to reduce the length of the copy in the container.\t[P] Text may be resized with no loss of functionality. [F] User experiences some loss of functionality when text is resized. Time Limits\tN/A as no time limits currently exist. In the event this is added, the tester will use the screen reader and visual observation to ensure any time limits under 20 hours and set by the content can be turned off, adjusted, or extended.\t[P] If there are no time limits or any time limits existing may be adjusted, extended, or the limit is longer than 20 hours.

Pointer Cancellation\tBy observation, verify that any functionality that can be operated using a single pointer has at least one of the following true: No down-event, abort or undoNo up-reversal (unless it is essential) [P] There is no down-event, abort, undo or there is no up-reversal (unless it is essential). [F] There are down-events, aborts, undos and up-reversals that are not essential. Motion Actuation\tBy observation, verify that there are alternatives to any feature requiring device motion (like Face ID) and that there is no required shaking or tilting of the device, etc. Note: Taking a picture with the device is an exception because it is an essential function with no alternative.\t[P] If all functions using motion have an alternative that doesn’t require shaking or tilting of the device.

[F] Any custom UI components are missing a name, role or value. Keyboard Focus Visibility\tUse a keyboard connected to the device and verify ability to tab through page elements, ensuring that focus is clearly visible.\t[P] If focus is clearly visible while tabbing through elements. [F] If focus is difficult to determine while tabbing through elements. Keyboard Focus Order\tUse a keyboard connected to the device to tab through page elements.

Focus Triggers\tUse a keyboard connected to the device to tab through and verify that no unexpected changes appear to page content by simply changing focus.\t[P] If no unexpected changes occur when changing focus [F] If any unexpected changes occur to page content when changing focus Redundant Entries\tN/A – Complex forms requiring redundant entries do not currently exist in the app. In the future, if forms with redundant entries are added and required, ensure that the field can be: auto-populated, oravailable for the user to select. Except when: re-entering the information manually is essential,the information is required to ensure the security of the content, orpreviously entered information is no longer valid. [P] Redundant form entries can be auto-populated or are available to select. [P] It is required that a redundant form entry be manually entered due to the security of the content, the previous information entered is invalid, or entering the information again manually is essential. [F] A user must manually input information into redundant form fields without the ability to auto-populate or select and it is not due to invalidity, secure content, or otherwise essential to manually entire. Focus Not Obscured\tUse visual observation to verify that when a UI component receives focus, no part of the component is hidden by other content (e.g. the footer navigation bar).\t[P] No focusable elements are obscured or hidden by other content / elements. [F] A focusable element is hidden or obscured behind / below another element. Consistent Help\tN/A – A help feature does not currently exist in the app. If a help feature is added to the app in the future and is included / repeated on multiple screens, visually verify that it occurs / appears in the same relative order and / or area on each screen.\t[P] A help mechanism exists and appears in the same relative area on each screen of the app. [F] A help mechanism exists and does not appear in the same relative area on each screen of the app. Accessible Authentication\tVerify that a cognitive function test (e.g. remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of the following: Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test. Note: We do not currently have control over the login process and cannot ensure compliance with this guideline.\t[P] The login process does not only require a cognitive function test to login. If a cognitive function test is present, it provides alternatives. [F] The login process requires a cognitive function test to login and there is no other alternative to bypass and / or gain assistance in completing the test to login.

The release candidate script is split between manual testing and automated testing (see description of automated release testing). For efficiency, we are working to automate as much RC testing as possible. However, due to limitations within the VA ecosystem around storing and accessing credentials to staging environments, as well as limitations by upstream teams on how often we can make PUT requests, many service calls that are critical to cover during release testing will remain manual testing, for now. Occasionally, upstream service downtimes will prevent QA from running portions of the RC script (ex: appointment services are down during the RC testing window, which prevents us from testing appointment details display and appointment cancellation). When this occurs, the QA assigned to test those cases works with the Product release owner, typically in Slack, to figure out appropriate next steps (delaying release signoff in hopes of the services coming back up to allow testing; releasing without QA signoff, with the risk of not having tested that portion of the script; etc.) "},{"title":"QA release signoff​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Release Testing","url":"/va-mobile-app/docs/QA/QualityAssuranceProcess/Release Testing#qa-release-signoff","content":"Once all cases in the release testing script have been run, a QA representative adds a comment to the release ticket which includes a list of bugs found (if any), and whether or not QA recommends releasing the candidate build based on our testing results.

Examples of this are displaying global navigation on every screen in the hierarchy, screen names that are unique and descriptive, using common screen transitions to communicate a screen's position in the hierarchy, and including descriptive back labels on each screen.Delivers value at every level: Each screen in the app should contain valuable and/or actionable content—no screens that are just lists of links. Extensible: The app’s IA and navigation model leave room to expand its feature set by considering and anticipating future organizational needs.Informed by Veterans: IA decisions are based on user research conducted with Veterans, examining their mental models around the organization of common tasks and undertanding of labels, as well as getting feedback on proposed solutions. Keeps it simple: Content is prioiritized and includes only what’s absolutely necessary—the fewer elements (number of levels in the hierarchy, number of screens, number of links on a screen) the better.

Always try to find a placement in an existing category first before proposing a new top-level category for a feature. Confirm new category names and contents with card sort research before adding to the app.Within a category, keep the hierarchy as flat as possible in terms of screens (limit the levels it’s possible to drill down through in order to get to child screens), but without inlcuding too many options on a single screen. If there are many features within a category, group the features and label the groups at category level before introducing additional levels into the screen hierarchy—this helps avoid cognitive overload.All features in the VA mobile app should have a primary placement within the app’s taxonomy, even if there are multiple entry points for it at different locations within the app (example of secondary entry points: personalized home screen content, cross-references within other sections).When content outgrows the current category structure, conduct card sort research to determine new category names and contents (Avoid using “hamburger” and “more” menus as primary navigation).

To create dark mode versions, select all of your light mode layers and duplicate them (on Mac, you can hold down option and click + drag to duplicate). We recommend visually grouping light mode versions together and dark mode versions together.We recommend adding light and/or dark mode to each of your frame names within your shipped file. For example, you may name one of your light mode frames “Profile / Landing / Light” and the dark mode frames “Profile / Landing / Dark”.After you have duplicated your light mode versions, you’ll need to change the color mode. You can adjust the mode by clicking the change variable mode icon and switching each library to &quot;Dark&quot; (see screenshot below).  You may also need to update some of your components within your content area to dark mode. The easiest way to do this is to select each component layer within the “Layers” panel on the left (you may have to click the option to “See All Layers”). You’ll want to look for the “Content” layer and may have to go several layers deep within this layer to find your individual component layers. Then, select “Dark” in the mode area within the design panel. Figma is not without glitches and will sometimes return your component to its default settings when switching the color mode. When this happens, sometimes resetting the component will fix it. You can do this by clicking the icon with 3 dots (“...”) in the design panel. Click the icon and select “Reset all changes” (see screenshot below). If this doesn’t work, you may have to update each component manually.When using the “Text Area” and “Default List” components, you may have to update each row within the component to dark mode vs. updating the entire component at one time.

Most common: Using existing component(s) with no updates Ideally, we’re using the building blocks we already have when adding new features to the app. If there is an existing component in the library that can be used and does not need to be changed, team members should add the component from the design system's Component Library and/or the VA Mobile App Design Library and avoid detaching it in your working file. Rare: Using existing component(s) with some updates If you believe the existing component needs to be changed, add the component from the VA Mobile App Design Library and detach it for ideation.

That being said, here are some general guidelines: For large features/features with brand new components, do a round of visual and interaction QA early in development (~when implementation ticket is in PR review).For all features, do visual, interaction, accessibility, and content QA on the 'last needed bug fixes build' for a feature, at the same time that QA is doing their fix verification and regression testing.Use the FE handoff pages in the working file to compare the work.For using real test users/data, see this Slack thread on logging in as a test user.On your testing device, complete a QA of the feature’s happy path.If you need a testing user to reach a particular screen or edge case, you can message a QA engineer in Slack for help.If bugs/issues are found, log a ticket.

For components that only live in Figma and do not appear on the doc site: Description: Add a short description of how the component should be used.Note: Most Figma-only components are sub-parts or building blocks of another component in Figma. They exist in Figma to allow designers to build and use components, but are not required from an engineering perspective. For one component in Figma, there can sometimes be multiple Figma-only components. Colors All colors should be pulled from the Design Tokens file (not light/dark theme files). It is also recommended that you use any semantic tokens that are available. Typography All text styles should be pulled from the Foundations Library (not light/dark theme files). Autolayout Components must be set up to automatically vertically resize as text changes. Typically, a component’s height will need to be set to “hug” to accomplish this. Components must be set up for responsive widths. Here are some potential ways to achieve this: Variant widths may need to be set to “fill” at 360px.Constraints may need to be set to &quot;left and right&quot; or “scale.”Autolayout properties may need to be customized depending on the component’s design. Properties Properties should be listed in an order that mimics the component’s visual layout from top to bottom and left to right.For main components, show nested properties as appropriate.Variants should be named and set up consistently. Type: Appears below Mode. Used for things like Primary / Secondary or H1 / H2.Layout: Appears below Type. Used for things like Horizontal / Vertical or varying quantities.State: Appears below Layout.
