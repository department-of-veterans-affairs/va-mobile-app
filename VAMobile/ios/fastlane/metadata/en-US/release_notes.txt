We updated the app with several improvements to secure messaging, privacy, and usability:

- Added an alert directing Oracle Health users to MHV for now
- Simplified secure messaging with auto-filled care systems and no duplicate recipients
- Removed in-app survey comments to better protect Veteran privacy
- Improved timezone display for Asia and Pacific regions
