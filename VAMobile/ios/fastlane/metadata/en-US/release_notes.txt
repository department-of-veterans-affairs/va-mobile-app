Users can now seamlessly access specific VA.gov web views—such as Notification Preferences, Claims, and Appointments—without needing to log in again. On the Home Screen, Disability Rating and Latest Payment information are now hidden by default, with the option to toggle visibility. Updates to the Veteran Status Card also make it easier to access and display your Veteran status.
