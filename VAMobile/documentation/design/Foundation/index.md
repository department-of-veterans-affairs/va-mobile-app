# Foundation

The Foundation section provides information about the visual language and styles used across VA platforms.
Behind every aspect of the language lies an intention: to convey interactivity, provide structure to content, and impart a sense of space and context.

## A consistent experience
In order to maintain a cohesive user experience across VA platforms, it is imperative that design choices are applied thoughtfully and consistently as Veterans navigate across products and services.

## Accessibility
While this guide will always provide accessible samples and usage guidelines, it is still possible to create inaccessible designs using the components and utilities available in this Design System. Always remember that the audience using VA platforms may not be visual users, may experience color blindness, or have difficulty handling low contrast ratios. Never use color alone as an affordance, always allow users to control automated content, and provide alternative navigation options.
