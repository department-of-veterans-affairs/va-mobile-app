# How to use design tokens

Our design tokens are available for both designers and engineers to use in their work.

## Getting started

### Designers
Our design tokens are available for designers in the [Design Tokens library in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rdLIEaC9rVwX70QbIGkMvG/%F0%9F%93%90-Design-Tokens?type=design). To install the library, follow the instructions on the [For Designers page](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/design/About/designers#add-a-library-to-your-project). The library is updated at the same cadence as the engineering files.

### Engineers
Our design tokens are available in JavaScript format for React Native engineers as a package on NPM. To install the library:

1. Add the [@department-of-veterans-affairs/mobile-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@department-of-veterans-affairs/mobile-tokens) library as a dependency in your projectâ€™s package.json. (Check NPM for the latest version)
2. Follow the instructions in the README linked above for additional information on how to import and utilize the tokens in your project.
