## Documentation and resources

### Working with the design system

The VA Mobile Design System is the VA Mobile App’s front-end framework. Before getting started, we recommend that you get familiar with the VA Mobile Design System and how you can use it as part of your design process. Each section includes some helpful information:

* [Components](https://design.va.gov/components). Components are the building blocks of the user interfaces. For example, accordions and buttons. Some of these have strict usage guidelines, so please become familiar with them.

### Referencing the VA.gov design system

The VA Mobile Design System is an extension of the VA.gov Design System. Additional guidance can be found in each section:

* [Content](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide). Our house style guide for VA.gov. Follow the guidelines to help you create a consistent, helpful experience for Veterans.
* [Foundation](https://design.va.gov/foundation). This section explains VA.gov’s base styles and visual language.
* [Patterns](https://design.va.gov/patterns). Patterns define how components, content strategy, information architecture, accessibility, and visual design work in tandem to solve Veterans’ needs. Here you will find patterns to ask users for specific pieces of information and how to help a user to complete a task or interaction.
* [Templates](https://design.va.gov/templates). Templates, or page layouts, are composed of components within a single page. A layout can contain multiple variations of a component depending on the context.

### Design resources

The website displays examples of the various components and patterns in use in the VA Mobile App. You can use your browser’s web inspector to view the specs for each component.

The Design System Team also provides a complete Figma library of core components.

## Design libraries

The Design System team provides a Figma library for use by teams.

### Add the Design Library to your project

Use the design library to access all components. In Figma, the design library lives in the cloud. Thus you do not need to download the library. The Design System Team updates the design library in order to keep it in sync with the va-mobile-library code which contains our React Nativeweb components.

To access and enable the [Design Library](https://www.figma.com/file/QVLPB3eOunmKrgQOuOt0SU/%F0%9F%93%90-DesignLibrary2.0---VAMobile?type=design), follow these steps:

1. In the Figma menu bar, navigate to Figma > Libraries to open the Libraries modal
2. In the modal, find the DesignLibrary2.0 - VAMobile file
3. Click the “Add to file” button to add the design library to your file

Once you’ve loaded the library, you should be able to access everything in it by navigating to Assets > DesignLibrary2.0 - VA Mobile or Resources > Components > DesignLibrary2.0 - VA Mobile. Note that you cannot edit the design library directly. The Design System Team manages this library.

## Figma

VA mobile design teams at Ad Hoc use Figma to view, share, and collaborate on our work. Only designers actively working on products at VA can be added to Figma. Once you have been added, you may access the [Design Library](https://www.figma.com/file/QVLPB3eOunmKrgQOuOt0SU/%F0%9F%93%90-DesignLibrary2.0---VAMobile?type=design) in the cloud.

### Get added to Figma

1. Go to [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) and [create a Figma account](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039811114-Create-a-Figma-account)
2. In the #va-mobile-app-platform channel in Slack, ping a Figma admin (currently Jen Ecker) requesting to be added.
3. Receive the invite via email and accept the invitation.
4. Boom, you’re in!

### Using Figma

Figma contains a few important features that help teams work together:

* Files (including libraries) live in the cloud, rather than locally on your machine
* You receive library updates automatically (a big advantage of using Figma)
* You can see what everyone else is working on in the VA workspace
* Developers can inspect any element on a page
* You can [create a branch](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/How-We-Work/figma-branching) of your file at any time
