## Content considerations
* Refer to the [VA Design System for content considerations](https://design.va.gov/components/loading-indicator#content-considerations)

## Accessibility considerations
* Refer to the [VA Design System for accessibility considerations](https://design.va.gov/components/loading-indicator#accessibility-considerations)
* The loading indicator component is used to notify users that the page content is loading. On the website, W3C WAI-ARIA aria-live="polite", aria-label and aria-valuetext are used to ensure screen reader users are also provided the same information. On the mobile app, use the equivalent accessibility hints and labels in React Native.
