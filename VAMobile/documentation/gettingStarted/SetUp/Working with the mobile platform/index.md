title: Working with the mobile platform
---
The Mobile Platform and Feature teams work together to deliver high-quality, cohesive mobile experiences for Veterans in the VA Health and Benefits app. While the Mobile Platform team provides the core infrastructure, standards, and guardrails that ensure consistency and reliability, Feature teams bring deep expertise in their product areas and own the functionality they deliver. The table below outlines how these teams collaborate across the product development lifecycle and clarifies ownership and responsibilities at each stage.
