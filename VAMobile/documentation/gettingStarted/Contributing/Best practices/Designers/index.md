## UX Platform Best Practices
* App is utility-first, “casual, convenient, contextual". It helps Veterans complete actions, not consume content-heavy material. Direct long-form content or research to VA.gov. 
* Content is brief and contextual: Keep text short, clear, and actionable. Progressive disclosure is key—avoid over-explaining. 
    * As required by Rules of Behavior  (ROBs), legally required notice must appear in-app as needed (e.g., Overpayments & Copays). Otherwise, direct users to the web.
* Best Practices  for platform level features:
    * WebView vs Browser: Authenticated flows → WebView. Public or content-heavy flows → browser. Avoid mixing native and WebView mid-flow.
    * Empty states: Use the Forms MVP pseudo-componentconsistently. No CTAs, minimal copy, context clues only, no illustrations.
    * Accessibility & Compliance: Follow WCAG POUR principles and be 508 compliant. Platform and design system best practices apply.
    * Privacy: Homepage anonymizes sensitive info like payments, disability ratings, or other medical information. Detail screens display full content.
