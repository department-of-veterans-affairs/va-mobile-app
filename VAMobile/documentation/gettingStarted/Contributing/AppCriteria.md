These criteria help determine whether a feature or piece of content belongs in the VAHB mobile app. They’re designed to guide product owners, designers, and engineers toward evaluating user value, technical feasibility, and long-term sustainability. Before proposing or building new functionality, teams should use these criteria below to assess whether the experience is appropriate for, and well-supported within, a mobile environment.

* It is a task that users perform repeatedly, and/or frequently
* It is information users need to access quickly and/or frequently
* If device-specific technology can improve the experience, it should be leveraged
* Authentication must be maintained, even when linking outside the app
* Infrastructure and services that features will rely upon must be able to support the volume the app will create
* Business logic should be built into the backend of the app

If you have questions about if your feature belongs in the app, please reach out the mobile platform team in [#va-mobile-app](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ).
