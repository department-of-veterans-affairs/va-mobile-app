title: Requesting features
---

**Step 1: Check the feature request backlog**  
Check the [Global Mobile](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1631) Github project board to see if your idea has already been suggested. If you don't see your idea in the backlog, proceed to the next step. If you do see your idea, please contribute your thoughts by adding comments to the GitHub issue.

**Step 2: Submit a feature request**  
Please submit your feature request using this [Github issue form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/new?template=feature-request.yml). In this form, you will need to clearly describe your desired feature. Please feel free to add additional artifacts or links that will describe the desired outcome and any adjacent planned or ongoing work.

**Step 3: Follow the status of your request on the GitHub project board**  
The Mobile Platform Team will monitor the Global Mobile project board and reach out with questions related to the submitted feature request. The Mobile Platform Team will then decide if and when to prioritize the item in their backlog. The team will communicate via GitHub with any questions. You can follow the progress of the ticket on the Global Mobile project board as it moves through the status columns.

Please note that new submissions are reviewed every week, and it may take some time for the feature request to get prioritized.
