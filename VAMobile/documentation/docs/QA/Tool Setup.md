# Tool Setup

## TestFlight (iOS testing app distribution)
1. Ask your engineering lead to grant permission for you to use the TestFlight app (they will need your company work email address, to add it to the list of allowed users).
2. Download the [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) app on your testing device.
3. Wait until you receive an email invitation to test the VA app via TestFlight (from the Engineering lead, via the work in step 1), then tap “View in TestFlight” or “Start testing”, then tap “Install” or “Update” for the app you want to test.

By default, TestFlight only shows the most recent testing build that was built. If you are looking for a specific build, make sure that the comments describing what's in the build or the build ID number match what you are looking for. You can find earlier builds by scrolling down and tapping "View Previous Builds", then picking a version (they are listed chronologically, with the most recent previous builds in the first version listed).
