# Beyond WCAG: Additional MCAG Guidance

Although MCAG is based on the success criteria outlined in [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), there are many of these guidelines that they have expanded upon to be more inclusive of native mobile apps. The list below includes much of this additional guidance that should be considered when working in the VA: Health and Benefits app.

:::note
MCAG rates each guideline as minor, moderate, severe, or critical. With minor being the least important and critical being the most important.
:::

## 1.1.1. Accessibility Enabled

Assistive technologies can reach, parse, and convey essential content and user-operable elements in the UI.

| **Test**                                                                                                                                                   | **Impact**                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Assistive technologies can reach and programmatically read all essential content, except when:<br/><ul><li>The content has a nearby equivalent alternative that's accessible to assistive technologies.</li></ul> | **Critical** |
| Assistive technologies can reach and trigger every user-operable element, except when:<br/><ul><li>The element has a nearby equivalent alternative that's operable by assistive technologies.</li></ul>           | **Critical** |

## 1.3.1. Real-time Updates Modalities

Real-time updates including essential status or value changes are conveyed in various modalities so all users can perceive them.

| **Test**                                                                                                                                                   | **Impact**                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |

| Elements' states distinction does not solely rely on color cues                                             | **Serious**  |
| Conveying information, indicating an action, or prompting a response, are not communicated solely by color. | **Serious**  |

## 2.1.2. Simplified Gestures

User actions that require complex gestures, like path-based or multipoint gestures, have a single-pointer alternative.

| **Test**                                                                                                                                                   | **Impact**                  |

## 3.3.2. Scaled Text Legibility

When text is scaled to the maximum size allowed by the operating system, it is not clipped, obscured, overlapped, or covered by other texts or elements.

| **Test**                                                                                                                                                   | **Impact**                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Text lines do not exceed the viewport width, causing a two-dimensional scroll.                         | **Moderate – Serious** |
| Spaces between paragraphs (on subsequent paragraphs) should be at least two tines of the line spacing. | **Minor**              |

## 3.3.5. Text Lines Length

Text rows are adaptive to the viewport’s width and have a legible length.

| **Test**                                                                                                                                                   | **Impact**                  |
