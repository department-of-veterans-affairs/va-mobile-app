## Locating the VA: Health and Benefits app

With the recent update to iOS 18, users can now customize the appearance of their app icons without an additional shortcut or appearance customization app. There are options for light and dark mode for the app icons or to completely customize the color of the icons themselves. Prior to the update, we would have asked a sighted participant to locate the app icon with the white "VA" and blue background, however, a participant's app icon may no longer visually appear this way. On Android devices, it is also common for a user to customize their icons, font styles, etc. using shortcuts or apperance customization apps.

Instead of relying on the app icon's appearance to describe and verify that the participant has the VA: Health and Benefits app installed, you should consider building a few extra minutes into your research study plan to verify that the participant has the app by asking them to open the app and visually looking at the splash / login screen in their screen share.

If a third party company will be verifying this for you, notify your recruiter that they will need to request that the Veteran open the app and visually verify that they have the correct app installed. You should also consider supplying screenshots of the login screen to the recruiter in both dark and light modes, so that they have it to make the visual comparison themselves.

For screen reader participants who are using VoiceOver or TalkBack, no matter what color options or icon style they may have chosen to use on their device, both screen readers will still announce the app as "VA".

## iOS

### How to enable screen sharing in Zoom when using VoiceOver

1. In Zoom, navigate/swipe to the "share" (button) and double-tap
2. Double-tap on the first option: "screen" (button)
3. Double-tap on "start broadcast" (button)
4. The participant will then hear a countdown (3, 2, 1) and the screen will begin broadcasting.

### Screen Curtain

When VoiceOver is active and the participant has begun sharing their screen with you, you may notice that the screen is black and that you cannot see anything that is being shared. This is called [screen curtain](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111797). If a participant has screen curtain enabled, you will not be able to see anything on the participants' screen unless they disable it.

[Read instructions on how to disable screen curtain](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/keep-the-screen-off-iph756788a12/ios)

:::note
If you instruct a user to turn off screen curtain during a session, offer to help them re-enable it before ending the session. Provide these instructions (the same instructions used to disable it) while they are still sharing their screen so that you can verify that screen curtain is re-enabled.

## Android

### How to enable screen sharing in Zoom when using TalkBack

1. By default, Zoom will typically default to "active speaker" mode. To display the toolbar, the participant can double-tap the screen with one finger.
2. Once the toolbar is displayed in Zoom, the particpant should navigate/swipe to the "share" (button) and double-tap ("share" should be option 6 of 11 in the Zoom toolbar).
3. The participant should navigate through the list until they get to "screen" (this is usually the 6th option in the list), then double-tap.
4. The participant will then read out the disclaimer for sharing their screen. Instruct the participant to navigate to "start now" (button) and double-tap.
5. After sharing the screen, Zoom will usually take the user out of Zoom and back to their home screen (or the last screen they were on prior to joining the meeting). Instruct them to return to the Zoom app to be able to access the chat area and access the link to the build.

:::note
After the participant opens the Zoom app again, it will typically default them back to the share option, although it will now announce as "stop share" (Chat should be option 4 of 11 in the Zoom toolbar).

### Screen Curtain / Screen Shade

Some Android devices do have the ability to enable screen curtain on their device. If a participant has shared their screen with you during a session and their screen is black, dimmed, or is not changing, it is possible that their device support screen curtain and that it is enabled. Unfortunately, there is not a simple gesture available to disable screen curtain.

To disable screen curtain on an Android device, the participant should:

1. Triple-tap the screen once or navigate to TalkBack settings within device settings (Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack) to open the TalkBack menu.
2. Instruct the participant to locate an option for "screen curtain", "screen shade", or "show screen". Depending on the participant's Android device manufacturer (Google, Samsung, etc.), this feature may have a different name or a different way of announcing / listing the feature. The participant should listen for an option that might impact the visibility of the device screen.Alternatively, they might also be ale to activate their voice assistant (Google Assistant, Bixby, etc.) and instruct the voice assistant to show their screen, disable screen shade/curtain, etc.
3. (This step will depend on the participant's Android device) After they have located the option for the screen curtain / shade, they should follow any necessary steps to show their screen and disable screen curtain. This could be a simple double-tap gesture to show the screen or could take them to their TalkBack settings where they may need to toggle off the screen curtain.

:::note
It is recommended that you ask the participant to talk you through the steps that they are taking to disable the screen shade / curtain and that you (or an observer) make a quick note so that you can help them reactivate it at the end of the session.
