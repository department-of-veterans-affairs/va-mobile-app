## Voice and tone
We follow the[ VA design system content guidelines](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles) on voice and tone. The guidelines emphasize talking to users person-to-person, being empathetic, and using a conversational voice when communicating with users. Since many of our features are health related we follow the [VA content guidelines around health content](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles) by also writing clear, plain language content.

## Accessible and inclusive language
Our app is for all Veterans. This means that we write for everyone and use language that does not exclude or harm any of our users. We avoid using ableist language such as the words “view” or “see” as they implicate sight. We also write with respect to the community by using people first language. We also avoid using words like impairment.

## Grammar

We follow [VA design system content rules](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) regarding grammar with the following adjustments:

### Capitalization

- Screen names (e.g. Home, Profile, Vaccine Records) are title case. 
- All other headings in the app are sentence case.

### Times and time zones

- We currently use `AM` and `PM` as this is default formatting in React Native.

## Naming
We generally follow [VA design rules for naming](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/naming-and-labels) forms and labels. 

When naming components in our design library we use the [Sketch format](https://www.sketch.com/docs/designing/symbols/organizing-symbols/#how-to-create-symbol-groups): Group-name/Symbol-name. When applicable, we also include subgroup names between the group name and symbol name. 


## Actionable language [TK]

## Dictionary (aka word list)

We follow the [VA design system word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list) for all terms in the VA Mobile app. 

## New content
Typically if it’s Veteran facing we need to run it by the Sitewide Content and IA team.
