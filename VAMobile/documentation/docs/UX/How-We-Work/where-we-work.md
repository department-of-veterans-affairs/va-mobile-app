# Where we work

## Whiteboarding 


### Mural

Main whiteboarding software where we brainstorm, do group work, and research synthesis. 


### Figjam

Optional software that comes with Figma. We‚Äôve used this to do group work, map out user flows, and brainstorm. Might eventually replace Mural but for now when in doubt use Mural.

## Wireframing


### Pen and paper

Feel free to go old school when drafting up ideas. Photos of low fidelity drawings can be inserted in Mural, Google docs, Figma, Zenhub tickets, etc.


### Balsamiq

Where designers are encouraged to work on wireframes and low-fidelity designs. We have two workspaces: 



* [UX Brainstorm and Working](https://balsamiq.cloud/s4uw4la/pnnwuqv) for ideation and work in progress.
* [UX Ready to Handoff](https://balsamiq.cloud/s4uw4la/pa3zodh) where we move finished work we want to talk to with the larger team.


## Prototyping

Both Balsamiq and Figma can be used to develop prototypes, although we typically develop them in Figma.


## UI Library and Feature Designs - Figma

Where we keep our UI library and work on high-fidelity designs, prototypes, and content. Each Project within the VA Mobile team has a specific purpose:

### 00 Start here üß∞ 
Meant to orient folks to Figma organization and how to work. 
- [Figma folder structure](https://www.figma.com/file/lWuA27DkIcFXZLnr2d960F/%F0%9F%A7%B0-FigmaFolderSetup---Resource---VAMobile?node-id=487%3A1386&t=UZQWXX9DFDz50aLt-1) üß∞
    - How we organize projects in Figma
- [Figma file workflow](https://www.figma.com/file/myVAkBM6nrpt3iC39RyjXz/%F0%9F%A7%B0-FigmaFileWorkflow---Resource---VAMobile?node-id=344%3A279&t=jC6U9HEvK543P9i4-1) üß∞
    - How we work on (and communicate the status of) projects in Figma
- [Figma file thumbnail + file naming convention](https://www.figma.com/file/fX8N9Y9Dz2Gtm3Syjjv4tR/%F0%9F%A7%B0-FigmaThumbnailTemplate---VAMobile?node-id=512%3A43&t=gNw3kFTFWViXpZwy-1) üß∞
    - How to use thumbnails and name files
### 01 Design Libraries

1.0 = App MVP, 2.0 = App with new navigation & beyond

- üìê[Design Tokens 1.0](https://www.figma.com/file/bGO6g5cCvWycrNjoK66PXc/%F0%9F%93%90-DesignTokens1.0---Library---VAMobile?node-id=952%3A17&t=Cj3aArAf6rU0EF9T-1)
    - The Design Tokens file includes colors and text styles. In the future, this file may include additional tokens such as spacing and sizing.
    - Design tokens are set up to be used within the Design Library components by using the [Tokens Studio plugin](https://www.figmatokens.com/). 
        - This is currently a work in progress. If you have questions, ask the Design Librarian.
    - Light and dark mode are currently managed by the [Light Theme 1.0](https://www.figma.com/file/yXL0MkEKyAPGXPZqRH0VFZ/%F0%9F%93%90-LightTheme1.0---Library---VAMobile?t=RcdT8wghx0Oab3F1-1) and [Dark Theme 1.0](https://www.figma.com/file/gOhb2kZvoQiXiGigqWZhnx/%F0%9F%93%90-DarkTheme1.0---Library---VAMobile?t=RcdT8wghx0Oab3F1-1) files.
        - This is currently a work in progress. If you have questions, ask the Design Librarian.
    - Only the owner (UX lead) and current Design Librarians have permission to edit this file.
    - Who uses this file: Designers on our team
 - üìê[Design Library 1.0](https://www.figma.com/file/QVLPB3eOunmKrgQOuOt0SU/VA-Mobile-Design-Library?node-id=1028%3A3927)
    - The Design Library file includes finalized components. Components are added to this file after they‚Äôve been vetted in production and approved by QA.
    - Components are set up to be used within feature files.
    - Only the owner (UX lead) and current Design Librarians have permission to edit this file directly. Everyone else is listed as a viewer.
        * Regardless of permissions, we should never edit the main file. Instead, we should create a branch and ask the Design Librarian to review our edits before merging them into the main file. [More about branching in Figma](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/How-We-Work/figma-branching).

### [CategoryName] 
-  üîç[FeatureName] - Working - VAMobile
    - Where designers are making features, handing off to ENG & QA
    - Also includes explorations for existing features that we aren‚Äôt moving forward with but want to keep a record of.
    - If you are designing using existing components please use the ones from the Design Library.
    - If you are building new components you can create them here. If adopted they will eventually move to the Design library. 
    - Who uses this: UX, PM, QA, ENG
- üö¢[FeatureName] - Shipped - VAMobile
    - Example screens from the app that are live in the app, comparable to Demo mode as a resource for folks.
    - Good for using as a reference but not the source of truth (the app is the source of truth)
    - Who uses this: UX, Product, outside Stakeholders/colleagues.
- üß™[FeatureName] - Prototype - VAMobile
    - Prototypes we‚Äôve built for research studies (one prototype per file).
    - Files should be read-only, so that we maintain quality for the usability study
    - Who uses this: UX, UR
### Resources üß∞
- üß∞ Toolbox
    - Includes files that might be helpful like Material and iOS kit to grab native components.

    - Each team member has their own sandbox file.
    - If you are working on something together consider working or moving Sandbox work to a Working file.
