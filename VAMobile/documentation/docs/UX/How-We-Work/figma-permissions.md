## Sharing files

All of our Figma files are set so “**anyone with the link can view**.” If you’re having trouble sharing a file with someone outside of the VA Mobile App team, reach out to the UX Lead or Design Librarian for help.


## Setting permissions

### Adding members or guests to the team
1. Admin, Owner, or Editor [invites new Member or Guest to VA Mobile App team](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040453113-Add-members-or-guests-to-an-organization) as an Editor or Viewer.
    1. **Members** must have an Ad Hoc email address and can be set as an Editor or Viewer.
    2. **Guests** will not have an Ad Hoc email address and will automatically be set as a Viewer-restricted.
2. **Member** or **Guest** accepts the invitation to join the VA Mobile App team.
3. In Figma, a **Member** or **Guest** will need to switch to the Ad Hoc organization in the top left corner, click on All Teams, and open the VA Mobile App team’s space.
4. **Member** or **Guest** can now see all of our Figma files.
    3. **Members** will be able to Edit or View files depending on their permissions.
    4. **Guests** will be able to view files and use the library in their private drafts.
