## Our approach
As [outlined in our project mission](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/product/Mobile-Roadmap.md#outcomes-roadmap), the VA: Health and Benefits app should be a trusted source for Veterans to quickly and easily check the status of their VA services and complete simple, transactional tasks across their health and benefits. In order to accomplish this we approach our design work by the following values:

- Accessibility first
  - The VA Mobile App is an application that supports all users and their needs. This means we design all aspects of the application to be inclusive and accessible. 
- Human centered
  -  In all aspects of the design process, we must understand and connect with Veterans on a human level. 

We utilize these values in our design process that involves:

- Discovery 
  - In order to understand a new feature or problem we interview users, go through research done by other VA teams, and/or look at other companies or applications for inspiration. 
- Iteration cycles 
  - In most cases, we go through several iterations of a design before it is handed off to engineering. Most designs begin with sketches or low-fidelity mockups in Balsamiq.
- Accessibility & technical feasibility reviews
  - These reviews are conducted when appropriate and are used to clarify designs from an accessibility and engineering perspective.
- Incorporation of standard mobile conventions 
  - In an effort to utilize components and functionality that userâ€™s are most familiar with.

## Principles [TK]
Principles help in establishing a foundation for a system or application. They allow teams to have a unifying vision and objective standard of measurement. 

## Accessibility 
It is important that the VA mobile app is usable and accessible to all Veterans. Disabilities can be temporary or permanent and can affect how Veterans move, see, hear, communicate, learn, understand, and process information. As a result, our app is designed with accessibility in mind from the start and is a factor in every step of our process from discovery to QA. 

### Based on VA standards
The [VA design system](https://design.va.gov/) does not have comprehensive accessibility guidelines. However it does [provide accessibility samples and guidelines](https://design.va.gov/design/#accessibility) when it comes to design, content, and components. We base our design system on this existing system with modifications for native mobile. 

### Content takes center stage
All content throughout the app is clear and direct to ensure that users understand the information presented to them. 

### Go beyond guideline standards
The VA Mobile app targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA and Level AAA success criteria, and section 508 guidelines. For more information, see the following resources:

- [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
- [508 guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#508-chapter-1-application-and-administration)

### Comprehensive disability support
We aim to provide a usable experience for all Veterans and include disability support for:

- Individuals who use assistive technology
- Individuals with physical disabilities 
- Individuals with mental or cognitive disabilities

### Assistive technology support
Our app and components are tested for accessibility with automated and manual techniques. Users should expect to be able to access our app using modern assistive technologies. These include native and third-party tools like:

- Screen readers
- Speech recognition programs
- Supports for low vision and color blindness
- Bluetooth keyboards
- Tools for readability

### Beyond disabilities
Accessibility also goes beyond disabilities and we seek to provide access to our app for users with limited connectivity and device performance. 

### Color
All of our designs have a 4:1 color contrast ratio.

### Touch targets
Touch targets should be a minimum of 44px by 44px.

## Information Architecture
[Information architecture (IA) focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html).

The [sitemap/flow diagram](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture) outlines the information architecture that the current (post-MVP) VA Mobile App's navigation follows. The goal of this diagram is to outline all the current screens and actions in the app.

### IA Principles [TK]
Our IA principles are used to help Veterans find information and complete tasks within the app.
