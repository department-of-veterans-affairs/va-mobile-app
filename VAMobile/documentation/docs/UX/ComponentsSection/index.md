The VA Mobile app is designed using components to help to ensure consistency across the app's features. This section includes component descriptions, examples and resources (UX and ENG). 
Components can also be found in Figma in the [VA Mobile app Design  Library](https://www.figma.com/file/QVLPB3eOunmKrgQOuOt0SU/VAMobile-DesignLibrary1.0-%F0%9F%93%90?node-id=501%3A40&t=P62TR9FmT9E6a4O2-1).
