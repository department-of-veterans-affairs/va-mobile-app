## Our approach

UX designers and researchers on the flagship mobile app’s team use various research methods grounded in human-centered design methods in order to stay current on the Veteran experience using the flagship mobile app. The team employs both qualitative and quantitative research activities based on the types of questions we’re trying to answer, and delivers these activities in an agile development cycle. A question-led approach ensures we stay focused on the specific things we need to learn to support the product roadmap. 

### Working together with Veterans
When we talk to Veterans in 1:1 sessions, we use SAMHSA’s trauma-informed principles to guide our interactions with Veterans. Trauma-informed principles ensure research sessions with Veterans and the team are led with care. Members of the mobile UX team are actively involved in the VA’s trauma-informed community of practice.

### Types of research
The team uses the following research methods:

* Veteran interviews (remote and in-person)
* VA employee interviews
* Journey mapping
* Card sorting
* Prototype testing
* Concept Testing
* Competitive analysis
* Mobile app review analysis

We incorporate research in a dual track agile approach. We use evaluative methods to gain insight into: 

* Newly released mobile app features in production
* Upcoming feature ideas using clickable prototype simulations

We use generative methods to:

* Gain a deep awareness of the current mobile app experience, 
* Explore new areas of the app we want to consider for our roadmap, 
* Uncover unmet Veteran needs 

Using a mixed method approach, findings from qualitative activities are compared against patterns emerging from analysis of quantitative sources, which include Google Analytics and App Store reviews. For example, if we see GA metrics indicating a large percentage of users are stopping at a certain point in the claims flow, 1:1 interviews with Veterans will enable deep dives to explore how and why Veterans are using claims in the app, and what areas might be causing confusion. 

### Ongoing research: post release
On a regular basis, when new, larger features or improvements are launched, the team will do a quick check in with Veterans using the app in order to get feedback on the overall experience. This will enable us to hear first-hand from Veterans about the initial experience after release, and help set up benchmarking metrics to compare against future improvements as we continue to iterate on the feature. Because these sessions happen in production, they are relatively fast and easy to set up and execute.

## Running research 
The team works under the guidance provided by OCTO and follows the [design and research guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-at-va) maintained by OCTO’s platform team. This guidance includes instructions on how to set up, recruit, and run research studies.

Prior to embarking on a new research study, the team reviews any prior studies available in OCTO’s research repository. These studies might range from foundational to evaluative in nature, and this step ensures the team surfaces applicable insights that other teams have uncovered before moving forward with a new study in order to avoid duplication in studies.

### Research templates
The OCTO Design Platform provides templates for research plans, conversation guides, and research reports. 

- [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-plan-template.md)
- [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)
- [Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md)

In order to make running research studies easier and efficient, the flagship mobile app team has developed additional templates to support UX team members in the process. The templates on the flagship mobile app site should be used as supplements to the OCTO platform artifacts.

In order to encourage cross-functional team collaboration, UX team members can utilize a research observer sign up sheet template. This signup sheet template allows team members to look for open observer spots during the course of a research study and sign up for open sessions. 

The research study lead uses the information provided from Perigean, the VA’s recruiting contractor, to populate the signup sheet with the session dates, times and unique zoom links prior to circulating.
