We strive to create a product that is usable for all Veterans, no matter their abilities.

We take a proactive, accessibility-first approach to everything we build. Accessibility is never an afterthought. It’s considered in every step of our process, from initial discovery to QA.

We also believe in accessibility beyond compliance. We don’t just meet the bare minimum of accessibility recommendations. We go above and beyond these recommendations to ensure we’re creating a product that is truly accessible to all of our users.

## Accessibility principles

### Based on VA standards
The [VA design system](https://design.va.gov/) does not have comprehensive accessibility guidelines. However it does [provide accessibility samples and guidelines](https://design.va.gov/design/#accessibility) when it comes to design, content, and components. We base our design system on this existing system with modifications for native mobile. 

### Content takes center stage
All content throughout the app is clear and direct to ensure that users understand the information presented to them. 

### Go beyond guideline standards
The VA Mobile app targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA and Level AAA success criteria, and section 508 guidelines. For more information, see the following resources:

- [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
- [508 guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#508-chapter-1-application-and-administration)

### Comprehensive disability support
We aim to provide a usable experience for all Veterans and include disability support for:

- Individuals who use assistive technology
- Individuals with physical disabilities 
- Individuals with mental or cognitive disabilities

### Assistive technology support
Our app and components are tested for accessibility with automated and manual techniques. Users should expect to be able to access our app using modern assistive technologies. These include native and third-party tools like:

- Screen readers
- Speech recognition programs
- Supports for low vision and color blindness
- Bluetooth keyboards
- Tools for readability

### Beyond disabilities
Accessibility also goes beyond disabilities and we seek to provide access to our app for users with limited connectivity and device performance. 

### Color
All of our designs have a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for text. It should also be 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders).

### Touch targets
Touch targets should be a minimum of 44px by 44px.
