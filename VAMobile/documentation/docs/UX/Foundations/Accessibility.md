We strive to create a product that is usable for all Veterans, no matter their abilities.

We take a proactive, accessibility-first approach to everything we build. Accessibility is never an afterthought. It’s considered in every step of our process, from initial discovery to QA.

We also believe in accessibility beyond compliance. We don’t just meet the bare minimum of accessibility recommendations. We go above and beyond these recommendations to ensure we’re creating a product that is truly accessible to all of our users.


## Accessibility principles


### Based on VA standards

The [VA design system](https://design.va.gov/) does not have comprehensive accessibility guidelines. However, it does [provide accessibility samples and guidelines](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/Foundations/Accessibility#:~:text=provide%20accessibility%20samples%20and%20guidelines) when it comes to design, content, and components. We base our design system on this existing system with modifications for native mobile apps.


### Content takes center stage

All content throughout the app is clear and direct to ensure that users understand the information presented to them. A more thorough explanation of our best practices for accessible content can be found on the [content documentation page](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/Foundations/Content).


### Go beyond guideline standards

The VA Mobile app targets WCAG 2.2 Level AA and Level AAA success criteria, and section 508 guidelines. For more information, see the following resources:

- [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
- [WCAG 2.2 (draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)
- [508 guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#508-chapter-1-application-and-administration)


### Comprehensive disability support

We aim to provide a usable experience for all Veterans and include disability support for:

- Individuals who use assistive technology
- Individuals with physical disabilities
- Individuals with visual impairments
- Individuals with hearing impairments
- Individuals with mental or cognitive disabilities


### Assistive technology support

Our app and components are tested for accessibility with automated and manual techniques. Users should expect to be able to access our app using modern assistive technologies. These include native and third-party tools like:

- Screen readers
- Speech recognition programs
- Support for low vision and color blindness
- Bluetooth mouse and keyboard
- Tools for readability


### Beyond disabilities

We believe that accessibility also goes beyond disabilities and we strive to provide access to our app for users with limited connectivity and device performance.


### The Section 508 law

Section 508 is a federal law that requires all U.S. government agencies to make their electronic and information technology and data accessible to everyone. By law, agencies must provide people with disabilities the same level of access as those without disabilities.
