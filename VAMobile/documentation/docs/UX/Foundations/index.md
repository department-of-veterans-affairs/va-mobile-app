title: Foundations

## Our approach 
As [outlined in our project mission](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/About/team-charter#team-mission-statement), the VA: Health and Benefits app should be a trusted source for Veterans to quickly and easily check the status of their VA services and complete simple, transactional tasks across their health and benefits.

### Values
In order to accomplish this we approach our design work by the following values:

* **[Accessibility](Accessibility) first**
  * The VA Mobile App is an application that supports all users and their needs. This means we design all aspects of the application to be inclusive and accessible. 
* **Human centered**
  *  In all aspects of the design process, we must understand and connect with Veterans on a human level. 

### Process
Our values are embodied in our design process:

* **Discovery & [research](Research)**
  * In order to understand a new feature or problem we interview users, go through research done by other VA teams, and/or look at other companies or applications for inspiration. 
* **Iteration cycles**
  * In most cases, we go through several iterations of a design before it is handed off to engineering. Most designs begin with sketches or low-fidelity mockups in Balsamiq.
* **[Accessibility](Accessibility) & technical feasibility reviews**
  * These reviews are conducted when appropriate and are used to clarify designs from an accessibility and engineering perspective.
* **Incorporation of standard mobile conventions**
  * In an effort to utilize components and functionality that userâ€™s are most familiar with.

### Principles 
Principles help in establishing a foundation for a system or application. They allow teams to have a unifying vision and objective standard of measurement.
