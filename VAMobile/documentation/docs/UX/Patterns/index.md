title: Patterns

Design patterns help to ensure consistent behavior across the VA mobile app's features. They typically make use of more than one component and may include display logic. 

Patterns we use in the VA mobile app include our navigation model, screen types, error handling, help content, form fields, pickers, and empty/loading states.
