# Redux Toolkit Overview

## Purpose

The **Redux Toolkit** package was built with the intention on being the standard way of writing Redux logic. It was mainly created to help address the three common concerns of Redux.

- "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
- "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
- "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"


## Benefits

Some benefits of using **Redux Toolkit** are:
 
- **Simple :**  Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.
- **Opinionated :**  Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.
- **Powerful :**  Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write "mutative" immutable update logic, and even create entire "slices" of state automatically.
- **Effective :**  Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.
