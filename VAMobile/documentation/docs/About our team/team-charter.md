## What we work on

## Team organization
The VA mobile App team is split into two groups covering different areas of focus.

### Red team
Health-related products in the app.

### Blue team
Benefits-related products, global app features like navigation and single sign on (SIS), and incremental improvements and maintenance (aka TLC).

See [Who we are](/docs/About%20our%20team/who-we-are) for the team roster.

## How we work

### Communications


#### Slack DSVA “#va-mobile-app”:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub

- Product and research documentation are on[ VA.gov repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app).
- Codebase and issues are on separate [VA mobile repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app).
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.

See [Team Norms](/docs/About%20our%20team/team-norms) for more details on team communications.

#### Estimation

We use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Points</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Complexity</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Meaning</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>xxsmall
   </td>
   <td>Trivial change - Up to 2 hours  (time mostly in submitting the work)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>xsmall
   </td>
   <td>Small change - Up to 4 hours  (More validation is required)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>3
   </td>
   <td>small

   <td>Routine addon/none new - 1 to 2 days (small work/high domain knowledge/1 or no moving parts)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>5

   <td>medium

   <td>Routine addon/none new - 2 to 3 days (medium work/1-2 moving parts)

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>8

   <td>large
   </td>
   <td>New work/High Complexity - 3 to 5 days (over 2 moving parts)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>13
   </td>
   <td>xlarge
   </td>
   <td>Too big/Risky, should be broken down - 1 to 2 weeks
