# Updating the Dashboard

Currently, the [monthly dashboard](Dashboard.md) needs to by updated with a fairly manual process. There are no APIs for some of the store data we use to derive the current dashboard, which makes automating the entire process difficult. Beyond that, some of the store data is very volatile and can take up to 7 days to settle. We currently update the reports every month after the 7th of the month for consistency and to avoid any discrepencies that happen due to Apple and Google's collection processes.
