# Updating the monthly dashboard
*Last updated July 21, 2023*

The [monthly dashboard](Dashboard.md) uses two types data sources: 
* **Google Analytics**: This data automatically updates every 12 hours directly from GA
* **App stores reviews & downloads data**: This data is gathered manually once a month and put into a Google Sheet that the dashboard pulls from. We are not using APIs to gather this data.

This documentation explains how to update the later data.

App store data is very volatile and can take up to 7 days to settle. **We currently update the data every month on or after the 7th of the month** for consistency and to avoid any discrepancies that happen due to Apple and Google's collection processes. 

## Overview of steps
1. Complete the steps in the [Steps to gather and record app store data section](#Steps-to-gather-and-record-app-store-data)
2. Review the [monthly dashboard](Dashboard.md) and confirm the board is operating properly post-data updates. Make adjustments if needed.
3. Posted in DSVA Slack channel #va-mobile-app-analytics that the updates are complete for the prior month and tag the following stakeholders:
    * Mobile app POs: Rachel Han and Ryan Twell 
    * Mobile app Project Manager: Jennifer Brown 
    * VA Communication stakeholders: Michelle Correll and Ty Brettnacher

Typically, the Slack update should also include a post that details:
* A reminder that all data except for the app storesâ€™ data points automatically update and that the message is only announcing that the manual addition of the app store data is complete.
* Any changes to definitions/analytics made in the last month that impact what users will see on the board.
* High-level trends/insights over time given the last month's data.
