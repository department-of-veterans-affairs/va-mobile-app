# Updating the doc site
For people who are comfortable with maintaining and troubleshooting setup on their local machine, this section covers all the steps necessary to initially get set up to update the VA Mobile documentation site [(Part 1)](how%20to%20update.md) as well as to update it each time after that [(Part 2)](Gettingsetup.md).

For people who do not wish to maintain and troubleshoot a local setup, we will be adding instructions for how to update via Codespace when [ticket 9190](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/9190) is completed.
In the meantime, if you need to update the doc site and are not an engineer, please reach out to the QART tech lead for assistance.
