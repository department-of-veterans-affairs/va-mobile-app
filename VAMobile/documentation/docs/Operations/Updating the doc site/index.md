# Updating the doc site
The old instructions have been removed from this site; we will be adding instructions for how to update via Codespace when [ticket 9190](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/9190) is completed.

In the meantime, if you need to update the doc site and are not an engineer, please reach out to the QART tech lead for assistance.
