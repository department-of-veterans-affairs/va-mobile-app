# Updating the doc site
For people who are comfortable with maintaining and troubleshooting setup on their local machine, this section covers all the steps necessary to initially get set up to update the VA Mobile documentation site [(Part 1)](how%20to%20update.md) as well as to update it each time after that [(Part 2)](Gettingsetup.md).

For people who do not want to maintain and troubleshoot setup on your local machine, skip straight to [Part 2](Gettingsetup.md).
