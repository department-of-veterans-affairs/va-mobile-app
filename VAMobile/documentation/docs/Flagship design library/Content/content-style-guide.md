## Voice and tone
We follow the [VA design system content principles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles). In following these principles, we create consistent, clear, and customer-centered content that is based on Veteran feedback. 

In addition, we follow [VA plain language standards](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles/plain-language) to help Veterans and their families find and understand the information they need.

Since we create content for health-related features, we also follow the [VA content guidelines for health content](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content).

## Accessible and inclusive language
We write for all Veterans and those who care for them. Therefore, we use people-first language that is inclusive of the wide range of abilities and experiences of our users. 
We avoid words that are insensitive to the disabilities faced by our users. For example, we don’t use “view” or “see,” since a number of our users are blind or low-vision. We also avoid idioms, such as “at your fingertips” or “give an arm or a leg.” Not only are idioms often insensitive to Veterans’ experience but also idioms don’t follow plain language standards.

## Grammar

We follow [VA.gov content style guide rules](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) regarding grammar with the following adjustments:

### Capitalization

- Screen names are title case. With the new navigation design, we will [change to sentence case for screen titles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/2575).
- All other headings in the app are sentence case.
- Buttons
 - For native actions, we use title case for iOS and all caps for Android.
 - For interface buttons, we use sentence case.


### Times and time zones

- We currently use `AM` and `PM` (both letters capitalized and no punctuation) since this is default formatting in React Native.

## Word choice, spelling, and naming conventions
### Content briefs
We use [content briefs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/content-briefs) to ensure consistent word choice and usage with other VA teams. VA Sitewide Content and IA team creates content briefs, sometimes in collaboration with the VA Mobile App content designer.
### [Word List](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)
We use standard American English spelling in Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The words on the VA.gov word list are exceptions or need clarification.
### [Naming conventions](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/naming-and-labels)
We follow VA.gov content style guide’s [rules for naming and labels](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/naming-and-labels)  for tools, products, benefits, offices, and programs. 
In most cases, VA.gov will have already established a name for a tool, benefit, etc. For cases in which we would like to suggest a different name or need help with naming an app-specific feature, we work closely with VA Sitewide Content team to ensure alignment.
 
## Error messages
VA.gov’s design system includes a section on [how to help users recover from errors](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/recover-from-errors). It details the structure, style, and tone for error and informational messages.

When writing an error message, we use clear, direct, and actionable language.

The VA.gov content style guide includes an [error message dictionary/reference tool](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/error-messages/) for different scenarios.


## New content
VA Mobile App team has a dedicated content designer. This person works with VA Sitewide Content team to implement their overall strategy and ensure alignment between the app and VA.gov. In some cases, the content design may request support from the Sitewide Content team by submitting an [issue ticket on Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=Sitewide+Content%2C+RLHecht&labels=sitewide+content%2C+sitewide+content-product+support&template=sitewide-content-intake-form.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E).
