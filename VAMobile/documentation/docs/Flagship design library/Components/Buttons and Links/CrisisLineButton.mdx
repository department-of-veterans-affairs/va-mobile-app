import ComponentTopInfo from '../../../../src/components/ComponentInfo'


The Crisis Line button provides users quick access to crisis care.

## Usage

### When to use Crisis Line button
- Crisis Line button button currently displays on the following screens:
     - Login
     - Home
     - Contact VA
     - Category screens, including Benefits, Health, and Payments
- We don't include it on all screens to prevent banner fatigue / semantic satiation.
- It should be considered on screens where there is a likelihood the Veteran is there because they're in crisis.
- If the button is the only number on the page, it's possible it will be used as a general call center line.

### Behavior
- When the component is tapped, it opens a full panel with more information.

### Placement
- Component should appear near the top of the screen, directly below the top navigation bar.

## Code usage

export const exampleString = ` <CrisisLineButton />`

<ComponentTopInfo componentName="CrisisLineButton" example={exampleString} codeString={CrisisLineButtonString} />
