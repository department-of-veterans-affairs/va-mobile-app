## Examples

<iframe width="800" height="450" alt="Image of master component in Figma showing light and dark mode" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com/file/QVLPB3eOunmKrgQOuOt0SU/%F0%9F%93%90-DesignLibrary2.0---VAMobile?type=design&node-id=7820-13268&mode=design&t=XkYEw6lPmNkmrNt0-4" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Usage

### When to use Veterans Crisis Line button
- VCL button currently displays on the following screens:
     - Login
     - Home
     - Contact VA
     - Category screens, including Benefits, Health, and Payments
- We don't include it on all screens to prevent banner fatigue / semantic satiation.
- It should be considered on screens where there is a likelihood the Veteran is there because they're in crisis.
- If the VCL button is the only number on the page, it's possible it will be used as a general call center line.

### Behavior
- When the component is tapped, it opens a full panel with more information.

### Placement
- Component should appear near the top of the screen, directly below the top navigation bar.

## Content considerations
- Copy should always be `Talk to the Veterans Crisis Line now`. Do not change.
- No punctuation

## Accessibility considerations
- The component should indicate that it is a button.

## Code usage
import CrisisLineCtaString from '!!raw-loader!@componentsDocs/CrisisLineCta'
export const exampleString = `<CrisisLineCta onPress={onCrisisLine} />`

<ComponentTopInfo componentName="CrisisLineCta" example={exampleString} codeString={CrisisLineCtaString} />
