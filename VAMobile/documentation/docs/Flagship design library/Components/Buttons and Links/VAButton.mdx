import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'

import ComponentTopInfo from '../../../../src/components/ComponentInfo'

A button draws attention to important actions with a large selectable surface.

### Usage
[Refer to the VA Design System for usage guidance](https://design.va.gov/components/button/)

#### Choosing between variations
* **Use primary for the most important action**. Use the primary button for the most important action that you want the user to take on the page, or in a section.
* **Use secondary for non-primary actions**. Use secondary buttons for any actions that need to be downplayed against other actions on the page, or in a section.
* **Use destructive for actions that have serious consequences**. Use destructive buttons for any actions that cannot be reversed and may result in data loss.
* **Choosing between colors**
    * In most cases, use the default (blue) color.
	* If the default (blue) color will not work (i.e. insufficient color contrast), you may use the base (gray) button.

#### Placement
* Buttons generally appear on their own line at the bottom of a form or section.
* Primary buttons usually appear first, or to the left, of a secondary button.

### Content considerations
* Reference the [VA Design System's content considerations for buttons](https://design.va.gov/components/alert#content-considerations)

### Accessibility considerations
* Guidance on using disabled buttons
    * Although VADS and USWDS have styles in place to support disabled buttons, disabled buttons are not available in the mobile app.
        * Disabled buttons are only available in VADS and USWDS to support legacy buttons that still exist on VA.gov today. These legacy use cases do not exist in the mobile app.
    * Instead of disabling a button in the mobile app, always attempt to find an alternative solution such as:
        * Providing additional context surrounding a button that tells a user what to expect when a button is tapped.
        * Allowing a user to attempt to submit a form even if an error exists in an input field (and then presenting the errors to the user to fix).
* For additional guidance, reference the [VA Design System's accessibility considerations for buttons](https://design.va.gov/components/button/#accessibility-considerations).
