## Usage

### When to use Multi-touch card
- The component should be used when a list item includes a lot of data and requires 2-3 touch targets. 

### How this component works
- Component should use established color patterns.

### Instances of this component in production
- Prescriptions

## Accessibility considerations
- The card's type and place in the list (ex. prescription 1 of 1) should be called out first by the screen reader. The screen reader should call out each individual touch target by its respective type (button, link; etc) along with its respective a11y hint. 
- Keyboards and Voice Access/Voice Control should navigate through each line item separately 
- Keyboards and Voice Access/Voice Control should navigate each touch area separately 
- Touch target UI should have clear and distinguishable areas/borders
