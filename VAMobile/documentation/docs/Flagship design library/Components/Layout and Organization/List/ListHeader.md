## Usage

### How this component works
When creating a list, the list header is always present for high-level information and interactions.

### Behavior
- **Center**: If the user selects the Cancel or Done button, the panel will close.
- **Multi-select**: If the user selects the Checkbox, all items within the list will be selected.

### Choosing between variations
- **Default**: If you only need to include a text-based title
- **Center**: If the list appears above the screen content like a full panel. This variation includes a title, Cancel button, and Done button.
- **Multi-select**: If multiple items with in the list can be selected

### Placement
The list header always appears at the top of a list.

## Accessibility considerations
- The component should be called out as a menu item. Its state (selected/unselected) and place in the list should be called out. Example: Selected. Acetaminophen 25MG Tab. 4 refills remaining. Menu item. 1 of 5.
