import ComponentTopInfo from '../../../../src/components/ComponentInfo'

Tags provide quick contextual keywords to inform status of a row or item. 

## Examples

### Default

## Usage
### When to use Tags
- When there is a list of information with different statuses for different items

### How this component works
- Only one tag should be used per instance. 
- The trailing icon is optional, as the status definition will not apply in all use cases. When the icon is used, the tag becomes a tappable button and opens a full panel.

### Choosing between variations
- Static vs Interactive
     - **Static**: To indicate a status that does not need further explanation or definition
     - **Interactive**: When you need to provide additional context for a status, use the interactive version with the icon.
- Status
     - **Informative (blue)**: To indicate neutral, default content. Consider the Informative status for new content with expected changes in status and trailing actions to take, like an Active prescription.
     - **Success (green)**: To indicate completed, finalized content. Consider the Success status for content with no further outstanding tasks, like a Confirmed appointment, or an In-Progress prescription refill.
     - **Indeterminate/Unresolved (yellow)**: To indicate pending actions or content that is still in-progress. Consider the Indeterminate status for content either the system or user can resolve, like a Pending appointment, or an On-Hold prescription refill.
     - **Inactive (gray)**: To indicate content that has no further actions. Consider the Inactive status for "dead ends", such as a Read message, a Canceled appointment, or an Expired prescription.

### Instances of this component in production
- In Prescription cards
- In Appointment cards

## Content considerations
- Use common VA language, words, or terms for copy.
- Keep copy to as few words as possible (1-2 words). There are exceptions where 3 or 4 words must be used in cases of VA-specific phrases or words.
- The trailing info icon is optional. Not all tags will need one for further definition of the copy.
- Use sentence case (i.e., Sentence case, not Title Case). Exceptions include words/phrases that use Title Case in other VA tools/sites.
- The trailing icon should clearly describe the type of content that it will display. For example, use the info icon when additional information will display on tap.

## Accessibility considerations
- If user has magnification settings, the trailing info-icon should scale along with the font.
- The icon is decorative, so it does not need to be read by a screen reader. If the icon is included, the tag should be read as a button.
