Components are interactive and non-interactive UI elements that can be grouped together or presented individually. They are independent, reusable chunks of a user interface that define a visual style and/or micro-interaction. A component is the smallest unit of measure within a design system. They can be considered concrete, a finite list: Button, accordion, table, etc.

The VA Mobile app is designed using components to help to ensure consistency across the app's features. This section includes component descriptions, examples and resources (UX and ENG). VA Mobile app components can also be found in Figma in the [VA Mobile app Design Library](https://www.figma.com/file/QVLPB3eOunmKrgQOuOt0SU/VAMobile-DesignLibrary1.0-%F0%9F%93%90?node-id=501%3A40&t=P62TR9FmT9E6a4O2-1).
