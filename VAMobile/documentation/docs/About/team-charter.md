#### Estimation

We use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Points</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Complexity</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Meaning</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>xxsmall
   </td>
   <td>Trivial change - Up to 2 hours  (time mostly in submitting the work)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>xsmall
   </td>
   <td>Small change - Up to 4 hours  (More validation is required)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>3
   </td>
   <td>small
   </td>
   <td>Routine addon/none new - 1 to 2 days (small work/high domain knowledge/1 or no moving parts)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>5
   </td>
   <td>medium
   </td>
   <td>Routine addon/none new - 2 to 3 days (medium work/1-2 moving parts)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>8
   </td>
   <td>large
   </td>
   <td>New work/High Complexity - 3 to 5 days (over 2 moving parts)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>13
   </td>
   <td>xlarge
   </td>
   <td>Too big/Risky, should be broken down - 1 to 2 weeks
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Team Norms

### Values

- We strive to create a product that is usable for all Veterans, no matter their abilities.
    - We take a proactive, accessibility-first approach to everything we build. Accessibility is never an afterthought. It’s considered in every step of our process, from initial discovery to QA. 
    - We also believe in accessibility beyond compliance. We don’t just meet the bare minimum of accessibility. recommendations. We go above and beyond these recommendations to ensure we’re creating a product that is truly accessible to all of our users.
- We aim to start simple when building new features and take advantage of existing components.
- We want to act as a partner to VA rather than a vendor.
- We get input and feedback from all disciplines throughout feature implementation.
- We make a point to celebrate our accomplishments.

### Communication

- Meetings follow communication norms as outlined in [inclusive meeting tips](/docs/about/inclusive-meetings).
- We use Slack "threads" to contain conversations in a single place and aim to work in public channels. 
- We don’t wait for meetings get question answered.
- We respect before/after hours time commitments and time zones. When we will be away we communicate availability in Slack, team calendars, and OOO docs.
- We work to balance having just enough meetings for folks to get work done while also feeling connected to team
- NEW: Meetings have agenda, notes, description and desired outcome, send along read ahead.
- NEW: Cameras are encouraged but optional in meetings.
- NEW: We strive to keep Friday a non-meeting day.
- NEW: Be considerate of long Slack threads. Signals of a thread getting out of hand are if you have to @folks to get attention or there are multiple conversations going on. If you see that happening, consider changing the format to a meeting and link meeting notes in the Slack thread.

### Slack DSVA “#va-mobile-app”:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

### GitHub

- Product and research documentation are on[ VA.gov repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app).
- Codebase and issues are on separate [VA mobile repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app).
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.

### PTO

- We will respect time off and understand that mental, physical, and personal health is the top priority for team members.
