# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```
$ yarn docs
```

This command installs dependencies, starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.


## Running Production locally

Running production build locally allows you to test features only available on production ex. search bar and Google Analytics.

```
$ yarn docs:localProd
```
