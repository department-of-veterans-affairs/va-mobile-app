<!-- Please fill out all of the relevant sections of this template. Please do not delete any areas of this template. It's ok if it's a draft, that's the point. This is just the first step in fleshing out documentation and the Component Committee will help. The tickets can be updated as the sections are finished and any section that doesn't need to have info should be labeled as NA -->

# Common Component Ticket
<!-- Goal of these tickets: Add new common components to, or make updates for existing components in, the VA mobile app design system. Only a subset of these will be applicable for updating a component, mark other ones as NA -->

## Component Details
### Purpose
<!-- [name of component] provides [purpose of component]. Ex: The loading indicator provides the status of an indeterminate loading time. -->

### Usage

### Component
<!-- Provide screenshots of the component (parts labelled and described), as well as screenshots of key variants (different states, light/dark mode) -->

### Accessibility
<!-- Are there accessibility requirements you want to point out? How should the component behave to be accessible to all? -->

### Best Practices
<!-- Guidelines that give more context, edge cases, etc. Example: Component should use established color patterns. -->

### Content Guideline

### Related Components/Resources
