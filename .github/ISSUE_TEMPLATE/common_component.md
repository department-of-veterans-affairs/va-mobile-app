# Common Component Ticket
<!-- Goal of these tickets: Add new common components to, or make updates for existing components in, the VA mobile app design system. Only a subset of these will be applicable for updating a component, mark other ones as NA -->

## Component Details
### Purpose
<!-- [name of component] provides [purpose of component]. Ex: The loading indicator provides the status of an indeterminate loading time. -->

### Image or Figma embed
<!-- [component image or Figma embed link goes here] -->

### Usage
<!-- Overview of when the component should (or should not) be used. -->

### Example in practice
<!-- Provide screenshots of the component (parts labeled and described), as well as screenshots of key variants (different states, light/dark mode) -->

### Best Practices
<!-- Guidelines that give more context, edge cases, etc. Example: Component should use established color patterns. -->

### Content Guideline
<!-- Guidelines to follow for content. Example: Use a single word to describe the status of an object.-->

### Accessibility
<!-- Are there accessibility requirements you want to point out? How should the component behave to be accessible to all? -->

### Related Components/Resources
<!-- Link to live design in Figma for inspection. -->

<!-- Links to similar components. Or, for an existing component, link to current listing on documentation site.  -->

<!-- Links to references (ex: VA or other design systems). -->


## Next Steps
<!-- Steps in process: cross-practice review with UX, QA and FE (loop as needed), add to documentation site, then hand off to Eng for implementation. -->
