## What's New content (App Store) - *required*
<!-- Define the content for the What's New sections of the app stores here -->
If there aren't any new features, use standard messaging: We added general improvements and fixed a few bugs.

If there are new features or major changes we want to announce, work with Content to finalize copy.

## What's New content (In App/Alert Box) - *optional*
<!-- Define the content for the What's New alert box here -->
If we use the in-app What's New alert box, the copy should be the same as what is being used for the App Store What's New section.

All changes should be coordinated with Engineering Team.


## App Store content changes?
