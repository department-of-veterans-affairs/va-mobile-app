## Visual and Interaction QA
Every epic should go through a round of visual and interaction QA, before release. Review [the high-level UX QA process info](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/UX/How-We-Work/designing-ui#qa) if you've never done it while on the VA mobile app team. 

## Ticket Checklist (for PM creating the ticket)

- [ ] Labels added (team, feature)
- [ ] Linked to feature epic
- [ ] UX, QA and Product all agree upon what the source of truth for design is (where to go to know the visual/interaction for a given screen), add a link here if feasible


## Acceptance Criteria (for UX QA)

-  [ ] Happy path visuals and interactions have been reviewed for completeness ("pixel perfect")
-  [ ] Any issues found have been documented (in a ticket, or other method agreed upon by the team)
-  [ ] Any issues found have been prioritized with Product & UX, to determine if they need to be fixed before release of MVP
