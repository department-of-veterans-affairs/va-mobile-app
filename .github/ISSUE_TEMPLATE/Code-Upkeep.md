## Proposed Change
<!-- What is it that needs to be changed for code maintenance -->

## Why Should We Prioritize?
<!-- What is it about this change that makes it worthwhile? Code downsizing, clarity, reusability etc. -->

## Coding Time Estimation
<!-- To the best of your ability estimate a sprint time requirement:
PTS#	Size	    Rough Timing
1	    xx-small	<2 hours
2	    x-small 	<1/2 a day
3	    small	    < a day
5 	  medium	  <2 days
8	    large   	< a week
13	  x-large 	A Sprint
	TOO BIG, Split	 -->
