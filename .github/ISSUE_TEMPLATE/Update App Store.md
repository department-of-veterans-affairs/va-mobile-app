## Description 
As the Veteran, I want all the app stores to accurately reflect the most recent changes to the app so that I know what to expect before going into the app.

## Notes 
- Determine what images and / or content need to be updated - UX to create images - [VA Moble Doc Site - Updating the app stores doc ](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/Operations/Updating%20the%20App%20Stores#designer-update-the-app-store-images)
   - Note if new feature is added then may need to consider how we list them in the first image in each app store 
- Team's PM is responsible for approving of the new images pre and post release
- UX to create a new folder with YYYY Mon and Feature in this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t_WOjaZkJKNR9oXEMczjtIePAFef2ym6)
- Images must be merged by Engineering before RC branch is cut to be included in the release
- As of June 2024 - new images need to be compressed - steps in 
- New images need to be run through something like ImageOptim per Tim before being added into the repo to remove any metadata that might be bloating the files
