## Notes 
- All work to be done before the end of the sprint that the feature is going out
- Some parts have a longer lead time (Va.gov App Marketing Page) so please prepare accordingly
- Whats New In-App Alert box content is not included here as its not part of the app store - see separate ticket template "In-App Whats New Content - Feature Name - Release" ex [8833](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/8833) 
- Any questions please reach out to Release Manager 

### Images
- Includes: iPad, iPhone and Android Phone (and a description image) 
- Process for [Updating the App Stores](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/Operations/Updating%20the%20App%20Stores/)
- Historically - UX creates the images backed on this [process](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/docs/Operations/Updating%20the%20App%20Stores/#designer-update-the-app-store-images) then Flagship PM validates the images and then works with their FE to submit the PR to update the images
- Images should be the same across Google, Apple and Va.Gov
- UX to create a new folder with YYYY Mon and Feature in this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t_WOjaZkJKNR9oXEMczjtIePAFef2ym6)
- Note if new feature is added then may need to consider how we list them in the first image which contains a list of features "Use this app to:"
- Work is done outside of the Release Ticket process
- As of June 2024 - new images need to be compressed through something like ImageOptim per Tim before being added into the repo to remove any metadata that might be bloating the files
- [Process doc for Update Va.Gov App Store ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/releases/Va.Gov%20APp%20Store)

### Content
- Inclues: App Store Whats New and App Description 
- Content will create the test for Whats New App Store (if we do not want to use "We added general improvements and fixed a few bugs.")
- This change is required for the Release process - notify Release Manager change is coming and when its done 
 

### Va.Gov Marketing Page
- Its a VA Marketing Page that will need to be updated by Flagship PM and has its own [process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/Teams/QA%20and%20Release/Release%20Management%20/Go%20to%20Market/VA%20Call%20Center%20Process)
- Images need to be stored in [Images in Use Github folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/Teams/QA%20and%20Release/Release%20Management%20/Go%20to%20Market/VA.Gov%20App%20Store%20Page/Images%20In%20Use) as VA pulls images from here
